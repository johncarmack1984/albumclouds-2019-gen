to only end the heartache
to shed this mortal coil
face pressed to the earth
I'm frozen to the soil

my only thought
with my last breath

to suffer slings and arrows
adrift and lost it seems
or take flight with the sparrows
the ghost that haunts our dreams?

drained of all resolve
my spirit pours from me
the fire's growing cold
please do not forget me

my only thought
with my last breath
pray for me now
the hour of death

one lost night against a sea of troubles
I could not hear You through the thunder's
peal
my only hope is that You cannot, not - be real

ooh ooh ooh
oh whoa oh whoa
oh whoa oh whoa

my only thought
pray for me now
my only thought
with my last breathI leap from buildings in a single bound
I'm flying downward near the speed of sound
if gamma rays blast through my fragile outside a hulking mass
grows as my cells divide

so far, there's nothing that you and I can't do
so far, well, mostly so far it's all been you
so far, so far

I'll light on fire with a single spark
my body’s battling the wicked dark
I'll catch bullets
just between my bones
and Vita Rays tear through my chromosomes

so far, there's nothing that you and I can't do
so far, well, mostly so far it's all been you
so far, something about this still rings true
so far, all that I need is you

all that I need is you

web-swinging is only wishful thinking
you lift my soul, you keep my heart from sinking

so far, there's nothing that you and I can't do
so far, well, mostly so far it's all been you
so far, something about this still rings true
so far, all that I need is you
so far, all that I need is youcling to your god and guns
the banjo's playing Hot Cross Buns
bucket seats set to recline
no need to cross the county line
are the Arabs closing ranks 
about to roll some Russian tanks?
shut the doors and save the kids
lock and load- just like Jesus did

the United States of Amnesia
make us numb, make it dumb, anesthesia
cut the cord, close the door, we don't know 'ya
it’s the zen and the art of xenophobia

let's keep them separate
melanin just can't succeed
"give me liberty… or something."
it's better if you just don't read
crank your phasers up to "slaughter"
turn your wine back into water
when you play this song, Al Qaeda wins
and Jesus was American

I am a breadwinner
I chose to brick these walls somehow
beneath the city spires
I gave my shoulders to the plow
cold and cruel the concrete
the wicked pavement chokes the sky
I chose this path
the one so often traveled by

tonight, we burn the wintry frost of night
tonight, we wish upon the fading light
tonight, our burning hearts will rise
tonight, we own the skies

my hands are bleeding where they often crack
the stars will sometimes burn with longing
through the choking black of night shifts piling each against the next
a Trojan horse inside my chest
is screaming for the life I left
my kingdom for a steady paycheck

tonight, we burn the wintry frost of night
tonight, we wish upon the fading light
tonight, our burning hearts will rise
tonight, we own the skies

tonight, we burn the wintry frost of night
tonight, we wish upon the fading light
tonight, our burning hearts will rise
tonight, we own the skies

tonight, we own the skiesyou're cutting some corners
leave nothing for mourners
leave nothing for the people in all those other places
just don't look at their faces
and you can believe that they don't bleed like you

you want to close your eyes
you want to make believe
this tangled web you weave is nowhere near the place you sleep
while other people's lives are cheap
and all of this is someone else's problem

and here lies the problem
it's not that you rob them
just look the other way
oh oh oh oh oh
just make some more excuses
your life stems from abuses
of other people's lives
you'll never have to see

you want to close your eyes
you want to make believe
this tangled web you weave is nowhere near the place you sleep
while other people's lives are cheap
and all of this is someone else's problemcan't you feel the angst just eating at you?
tape your knuckles for the fight
someone said the first shall be the last
see you on the streets tonight

and if you change your mind
here and now-with the rising tide
if you change your mind
cast your nets on the other side

you are not the contents of your wallet
you are not the space you rent
when you're eighty-five with no scars to show
the winner of our discontent
whose lips have you been kissing
hang your future from a blade
win it all, but something's missing
maybe drank the wrong Kool-Aid?

and if you change your mind
here and now-with the rising tide
if you change your mind
cast your nets on the other side

and if you change your mind
here and now-with the rising tide
if you change, if you change
if you change

and if you change your mind
and if you change your mind
and if you change your mind
and if you change your mind

and if you change your mind
here and now-with the rising tide
if you change your mind
cast your nets on the other side

and if you change your mind
here and now-with the rising tide
if you change, if you change
if you changemy old friend
need only speak your name
to summon a smile
I knew you when we had so much more in common
it's been a while
winter was cold the autumn was dire
love has no meaning
without desire
if we're gonna make it
we've got to set ourselves on fire

something to believe in
to only be inspired
oh whoa
oh whoa
to torch it all to cinders to only build a fire
oh whoa
oh whoa

my old friend
we used to sharpen our blades on each other
for the fight 
we used to plead
with the flame to ever only
stay alight
our backs are breaking
beneath the weight
some albatrosses
some aces and eights
our hearts are freezing beneath
their tempered iron plates

something to believe in
to only be inspired
oh whoa
oh whoa
to torch it all to cinders to only build a fire
oh whoa
oh whoa

oh whoa
oh whoa
oh whoa
oh whoa

something to believe in
to only be inspired (oh whoa)

to torch it all to cinders 
to only build a fire (oh whoa)

shut your face
high school jerks
we're about to show you how this works
are we cool?
laser beams
we're about to awesome all your dreams
and you'll say, "what are you, some kind of computer?"
and we'll say, "a cyborg pimp from the future."
and I'm going def for sheezy
I'm feeling a bit uneasy

let's get this straight:
oh yeah, we are the champions
we'll be battle dancing
unicorns
oh yes
battle dancing unicorns
it's not too late
you could gamble on the
heavy hitters
while we're battle dancing unicorns
with glitter

twelve-o-clock?
party rock
we're hip-hoppin' and we can't quite stop
aggro hair
grizzly Bear
bet you've never met a thousand-aire
then you'll say, "whatever, I think you're moronic."
and we'll say, "not really, we're only bionic."
and you're still in high school
but have to acknowledge
that we are professors at robot spy college

let's get this straight:
oh yeah, we are the champions
we'll be battle dancing
unicorns
oh yes
battle dancing unicorns
it's not too late
you could gamble on the
heavy hitters
while we're battle dancing unicorns
with glitter

to be what I just can't
impale myself upon the horns
I'm fighting just to be relevant
I'll battle dance some unicorns

I'm battle dancing unicorns 
I'm battle dancing unicorns
oh yeah
I'm battle dancing unicorns
I'm battle dancing unicorns

with glitter
with glitter
with glitter

we’ll be battle dancing unicorns with glitterto steal the wind from your lungs
to take the breath from your lips
I am trafficking bliss
I sell wholesale with a kiss
I am a dealer of words
I'll suck the buzz from your scene
and sell it right back to you
before I get away clean
before I get away clean
this is your stereo
and your speakers are blown
In this scenario
we are the Guns of Navarone
this is a mutiny
this is a masquerade
this is the pin pulling from a ticking hand grenade

shoot each word into your veins
sing until you can't feel pain

we are your own parasite
a wind blown pilot light
sinking like a lead balloon
something you cooked in a spoon
this a firing line
this is Sweet Caroline
this is a slot machine
this is a prison camp
minus any Steve McQueen

shoot each word into your veins (shoot into your veins)
sing until you can't feel pain (can’t feel pain)
you're going down hard (go hard)
you're going down fast 
you're going down like this might be your last
you're going down hard (go hard)
you're going down fast 
you're going down like this might be your last

to bind up the brokenhearted
we came here to bleed
to bind up the brokenhearted
you know what you need

to bind up the brokenhearted
to bind up the brokenhearted

shoot each word into your veins
sing until you can't feel pain
‘cause you're going down hard
you're going down fast
you're going down like this might be your last
you're going down hard
you're going down fast
you're going down like this might be your last
it was a dark and stormy night last night
bitter dark
rain fell in torrents
stabbing it's ghosts through the cold
and straight through our hearts

I've been waiting, in halfhearted sleep
for a promise I half meant to keep
just for hoping that hope still flies
wipe the sleep out of our sleeping eyes

fog that is lifting
the spectre of dreams we once had
speaks into the night
slumber is over
sunlight is streaming through
come into the light

I know
hope has not forgotten me
I know
I'm waking from the longest dream

I know
I know
I know
I know

I've been waiting, in halfhearted sleep
for a promise I half meant to keep
just for hoping that hope still flies
wipe the sleep out of our sleeping eyes

and hope still flies
and hope still flies
and hope still fliesI fight tsunamis with an umbrella
I deal the left hook like a Mother Theresa
I'm facing down death like a fly on the windscreen
you bring the warheads
I'm bringing ice cream
and I've got something more
and I believe

I've seen the Sun come down
I've felt its fire burn
and in the dark of night
I hold to its return

I'm screaming down into the black abyss
I was born for such a time as this
so hit me with your bad news
bells are ringing
tell me that I'm doomed and I'll keep singing
the fight won't end with me
and I believe

I've seen the Sun come down
I've felt its fire burn
and in the dark of night
I hold to its return
I know it's growing cold
and there's a lot to learn
I've seen the Sun come down
I hold to its return

night falls and the waters rise
leaders lead with the fear and lies
savior says don't be surprised
everything's gonna be alright

I've seen the Sun come down
I've felt its fire burn
and in the dark of night
I hold to its return
I know it's growing cold
and there's a lot to learn
I've seen the Sun come down
I hold
I hold to its return

it’s gonna all right
there’s a lot to learn
it’s gonna be all right
there’s a lot to learn
it’s gonna be all right
there’s a lot to learn
it’s gonna be all right
I hold to its returnooh ooh ooh ooh

back when the angels of heaven would sing
days when I still made you feel something
and before what might be
became what's already been
blizzards and bygones
the frost and no thaw
airways constricting
and vessels withdraw

and you look around but find yourself all alone
and you hunker down but the cold's
already in your bones
there's a flicker of desire
and a memory of youth
a faintly
glowing fire for some truth

I lit a fire
it started then stopped
elements will conspire
and mercury drop
and you look around but find yourself all alone
and you hunker down but the cold’s already in your bones

ooh ooh
ooh ooh

there's a flicker of desire
and a memory of youth
a faintly
glowing fire for some truth

can you stand the weather (ooh)
if winter lasts forever? (ooh)
can you stand the weather (ooh)
if winter lasts forever? (ooh)
can you stand the weather (ooh)
if winter lasts forever? (ooh)
can you stand the weather?
