I'm going in
(1 2 3 and go)
like a kamikaze
(like Geronimo)
a leap of faith
(and I finally feel alive)
3 2 1 I'm going in


I don't know if it's just me
but it seems that things aren't changing
every day is pretty much the same
with a little rearranging

If I do nothing I can't fail
no blistered hands, no broken nails
killing time, I'm paralyzed
with bitter dreams and hollow eyes

I've been waiting for a revelation
for a moment of clarity
conflicts and convolutions
ricochet inside of me

there comes a time for throwing caution to the wind
I feel the pulse again

I'm going in
(1 2 3 and go)
like a kamikaze
(like Geronimo)
a leap of faith
(and I finally feel alive)
3 2 1 I'm going in

(1 2 3 say when)
like a flaming arrow
(soaring in the wind)
a leap of faith
(and I finally feel alive)
3 2 1 I'm going in

I am so slow to commit
I have wasted years on fences
is it really true the shoes don't fit
is it only my defenses?

what if I don't measure up
don't listen well, don't smile enough?
alone and unknown up to now
need to change direction somehow

I've been open to persuasion
wanting someone to take the lead
it's a little disconcerting
signing up for eternity

there comes a time for throwing caution to the wind
and so my life begins

I'm going in
(1 2 3 and go)
like a kamikaze
(like Geronimo)
a leap of faith
(and I finally feel alive)
3 2 1 I'm going in

(1 2 3 say when)
ike a flaming arrow
(soaring in the wind)
a leap of faith
(and I finally feel alive)
3 2 1 I'm going in
I'm going in
I'm going in
I'm going...well lately I've been thinkin'
about some good home cookin'
just like I haven't eaten in the longest time
now I like potato chips now please don't get me wrong
but I haven't tasted momma's rhubarb pie in so very long

rhubarb pie in the summer
rhubarb pie made by my mother
nothing better in the winter
than rhubarb pie after dinnner

twinkies may be better
than a hole in the sweater
and the hole in the sweater
beats a poke in the eye
if I had my choice I'd leave this
gas station store
and then I'd travel back in time and
I'd sit down and have some more

rhubarb pie in the summer
rhubarb pie made by my mother
nothing better in the winter
than rhubarb pie after dinnner whoa

whoa whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa 

looking at the picture
in the sunday paper
of the politician he's talkin' to the press
and he looks like he's been eating lemons all his life
well, I think momma's rhubarb pie could solve
more problems over night

rhubarb pie in the summer
rhubarb pie made by my mother
nothing better in the winter
than rhubarb pie after dinner

rhubarb pie in the summer
rhubarb pie made by my mother
nothing better in the winter
than rhubarb pie after dinner

ah take me home... whoa
I like it with a crispy crust... whoa
and the sugar on top... whoa
oh it makes my mouth water... whoa
I'm comin' home momma... whoaMarty was punkrocker he went to all the shows
patches on swiss army pants and two rings in his nose
he had an old nash rambler
no insurance not much gas
and a dancing hula girl that bobbled on the dash

feeling kinda stupid one day he broke down
he drove his ugly car to the edge of town
he sunk it in the quarry just because he could
and because the rear defroster never worked too good

Marty where you going
whatcha going to
what's the point in not conforming
if it changes you
when this world runs out of answers
would you even know
does the truth have any bearing
on which way you go

he took the bus to santa cruz he hitchhiked to LA
a preacher man had picked him up and drove him half
the way

he said there's two kinds of people that I've met
those who ask the questions
and those who don't ask questions yet
then he turned asking marty which one that he thought
he was
Marty shrugged and shook his head forgetting what the
question was

Marty where you going
whatcha going to
what's the point in not conforming
if it changes you
when this world runs out of answers
would you even know
does the truth have any bearing
on which way you go

you'd do almost anything
that someone told you not to do
just because someone else told you it was cool
remember long ago
someone said to get a life
did you ever think they might be right?

Marty was a rebel
he never had a cause
it may be stupid and cliched but that's because he was

he spent his whole life straying from the norm
he was never hot or cold
just boring and lukewarm
it didn't seem to bother him
he didn't seem to mind
his cathartic life
just burried somewhere in the time line

Marty where you going
whatcha going to
what's the point in not conforming
if it changes you
when this world runs out of answers
would you even know
does the truth have any bearing
on which way you go

okay this is a new song it’s called fistful of sand

ha ha ha 

four kids in Memphis
should pay me five dollars
I wrote this song and they said they would pay me
and I want to buy a hot dogI want to see
all minds set free
like slaves to their deaths
they pledge their liberty
like awls through their ears
nailed to a post
they sold their souls to the things they loved most
now they accuse
my mind is closed
I've stood in their shoes
that's why I chose... Freedom

you've got words and clever jargon
self-support, what a bargain
you tell me my God is dead
you hate a book you've never read
telling me that I'm pushing you
whose world is this, who pushes who?
we've had to watch your television
subject to your decisions
we've read your books
and filled your schools
you burned the truth
with hate for fuel
you calculate your lack of reason
I hate this place, call it treason

mind for treason
force-feeding lies
but calling it freedom
masking the truth, to hide your dismay
turn a blind eye to the death and decay
but I will rebel
it's treason I choose
you can die by yourself
but I will refuse

a word of truth to worlds of fiction
I'd like to challenge your depiction
of your soul and your salvation
I'd like to shake you from stagnation
you take the nail and drive it through
your ear to show allegiance to
your god, the thing that you love most
yourself
am I coming close?
blind to see your own extinction
truth and lies have no distinction
shackled slaves must drop their chains
or slaves will serve themselves in vainwhat could this be, too much MTV?
chalk another fad up for its fall into infamy
what's in a standard if it changes all the time?
you're still having trouble in defining your own kind
need I remind you, we all knew you before
you threw the rocks at the stage from your glass house on the floor?
now you think you're punk, just because it's in
you found a foul mouth and a couple safety pins

got a peaceful feeling
I don't want to fight no more
got a peaceful feeling
I don't care if we're punk, or ska, or hardcore
enough for you, it's sad but true
you can call us names till your face turns blue
our assurance comes from God
it's nothing new
we'll never care 'cause we're never cool enough for you

that smug look on your face
your nose up in the air
your patches say you're open-minded
but still you couldn't bear
some punk thrown in with ska
you said it wouldn't work
well you can take your Vespa home 'cause ska made you a jerk

got a peaceful feeling
I don't want to fight no more
got a peaceful feeling
I don't care if we're punk, or ska, or hardcore
enough for you, it's sad but true
you can call us names till your face turns blue
our assurance comes from God
it's nothing new
we'll never care 'cause we're never cool enough for you

got a peaceful feeling
I don't want to fight no more
got a peaceful feeling
I don't care if we're punk, or ska, or hardcore

yeahI walked into the room, and she was right there waiting
leaning up against the bar
well she was perpertraitin'
slick as snot her spandex
and blacker than some coal
she set her gaze upon my bootie
with disco in her soul
so much for indecision
so quick did she decide
the temptress with her doors open inviting me inside
"I want to take you home with me"
said that sparkle in her eye
"I would like to honey, but I'm about to die.”

I have got a time bomb
I strapped it to my chest
when it blows I'm out of here
you can have what's left

the room got kind of quiet
and you could smell the fear
I only heard the jukebox play "a tear is in my beer"
"so what's the verdict Mister?
when's it gonna blow?"
I just winked at her and said
"darlin' I don't know."
time-bomb tickin' in the room
everybody goes someday
blows so fast you better be
somewhere where it's safe
thin skinned thread-bare thinkin’
now you're gonna die
don't try to rock the jukebox
just kiss this world good-bye

I have got a time bomb
I strapped it to my chest
when it blows I'm out of here
you can have what's left


what's the deal, don't you feel
alone now in the crying?
pushing up daisies now
there's better ways for you to diet
seeking after sucker wealth
suckers feel what suckers dealt
all your life you stuffed your face
now you're dead I rest my case
got a story here to tell
so you better listen well
some old lady in a church
got a nickel in her purse
you were rich, she was poor
you dropped some fifties on the floor
she dropped her nickel with a clank
she was thinkin' third world think tank

your god should just award
all the junk your arms can horde

the Karaoke master
the drunkard
and the jerk
ditch this sorry world and all its worth
keep your candle burning
waiting for the time
ready to explode
the bomb is primed

well I have got a time bomb
I strapped it to my chest
when it blows I'm out of here
you can have what's leftsome cowboys were a riding, riding on the range;
the grass was over grazed there, and spotted like some mange;
the buffalo were dead there, the trees they all were through
and if they saw some Injuns, they would kill them too

west or bust, in God we trust, “let’s rape, let’s kill, let’s steal"
we can almost justify, anything we feel;
I’m climbing up that ladder, more brownie points for me
I’ll work my way to Jesus you wait and see

said one cowboy to another, "I think it would be nice
if we could take these injuns and convert them all to Christ;
see, they are all disgusting, and bringing me great pain
and if they don’t believe me, we’ll put a bullet in their brains!”

west or bust, in God we trust, “let’s rape, let’s kill, let’s steal"
we can almost justify, anything we feel;
I’m climbing up that ladder, more brownie points for me
I’ll work my way to Jesus you wait and see

I am always shouting, when I go outside
how people should repent now, or they are going to die
my motives are all selfish, I’m a cannon brimmed with powder
if people do not believe me, I just beat them and yell louder

west or bust, in God we trust, “let’s rape, let’s kill, let’s steal"
we can almost justify, anything we feel;
I’m climbing up that ladder, more brownie points for me
I’ll work my way to Jesus you wait 

wait and seeI see a city on a hill
I see the only way to be filled
mighty rushing wind around us
Holy Spirit burn within us

burn. burn. burn
within us, within us
Spirit of truth
my eyes deceive me
teach me how to see
ears cannot hear
my mouth is to odry to speak
you have searched me, you, you know me
there is nothing good inside me
purge me make me clean
my heart needs courage so burn inside of me

me

burn within our hearts oh God
teach me to be still
let the tears roll from our eyes
all we want is Jesus Christ
we want to…

burn. burn. burn
within me, within me
Spirit of truth
my eyes deceive me
teach me how to see
ears cannot hear
my mouth is too dry to speak
you have searched me,you, you know me
there is nothing good inside me
purge me make me clean
my heart needs courage so burn inside of me

this little light of mine
I’m gonna let it shine
this little light of mine
I’m gonna let it shine
this little light of mine
I’m gonna hold it up
I’m gonna let it

burn. burn. burn
within me, within all of us
Spirit of truth
my eyes deceive me
teach me how to see
ears cannot hear
my mouth is to dry to speak
you have searched me, you, you know me
there is nothing good inside me
purge me make me clean
my heart needs courage so burn inside of me

Johnny's got a grip on a blissful life
he sucks on the smoke from the dope in his pipe
wrapped around his fingers, a noose is loosing slack
strangling his forearm to fill his veins with smack
P.C.P. spells gun to the head
half a syringe or a barrel full of lead
grasping at straws and coming up empty, carving with his life
this somber song of hope:
"kill me.”

Sally spells success M-O-N-E-Y
if she steps on some toes, it's an eye for an eye
she's climbing up the ladder, she's building up a wall
to block out the world or the fear that she'll fall
tightrope things, conviction never stops
money means nothing from a 40 floor drop
her security blanket has worn itself thin
she's hanging in the closet from a rope of her own sin

nothing changes, nothing will
always skeptic, primed for the kill
seeking nothing but selfish gain
filling your pockets again and again
selling your soul, taking your fill
grasping at straws, feeding your own will
killing your conscience, empty, bereft
losing your life for the world, you are left alone

some throw bricks through windows and yell
others beat their backs for fear of hell
two-edged sword that cuts flesh to the joints
the path is narrow, you missed the point
fistful of sand a pitiful prize
you're blinding yourself, closing your eyes
the point was made eons ago
chaff on the wind, your life's gonna blow
nothing you do, nothing can be new
what is good? what is true?
seeking to serve not ourselves, never
the Lord is God, we will live forever

nothing changes, nothing will
always primed for the kill
seeking nothing but selfish gain
filling your pockets again and again
selling your soul, taking your fill
grasping at straws, feeding your own will
killing your conscience, empty, bereft
losing your life for the world, you are left alone
if you could ever find it in your heart
if you could ever think to find some sympathy
never ask us to play this song, or that song about our pants, or our kitty-doggie
never ask us to play Godzilla, or shut up, or a song we haven't written yet about that time we did some stuffhey there buddy, go on, get outta there, that’s my dog food

mmmmm Alpo

when I was young, in the good old days on the farm
all I ate was dog food
all the poor dogs whimper and they would yelp as I smiled and chewed

dog food! a whole meal for a nickel
dog food! on some bread with a pickle
dog food! guaranteed to drive your hunger away
dog food! keeps a horse employed
dog food! good for girls and boys
dog food! most kids like it more than broccoli

nasty food I must plug my nose to swallow
because my mom's on probation
eggplant, brussel sprouts go down and come out
nothing goes down smooth like Ken-L-Ration

dog food! a whole meal for a nickel
dog food! on some bread with a pickle
dog food! guaranteed to drive your hunger away
dog food! keeps a horse employed
dog food! good for girls and boys
dog food! most kids like it more than broccoli

Alpo! kibble! Iams! Purina! Milkbone! Soupbone! horse meat! yeah!

this time I can see it
this time when I see her face, the words will come out right
I comb my hair, and put on my favorite shirt
I take one deep breath, then I go outside
