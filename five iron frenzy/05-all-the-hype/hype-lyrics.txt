what
is up“how is your life?"
"how are things?"
"great they are going okay!"
something stale and superficial
not to ruin your day
something swell
something gay
with the toothiest smile
something sappy
something happy
something smells like bile
I do not want to burst your bubble
not to rain on your parade
underneath my skin I am tired
limping down this path I have made

the clap of thunder in my veins
breaks on barren manifold
still and small and so mundane
the greatest story ever told
the greatest story ever told
the greatest story ever told

are you crawling through the dismal?
gray of nothing
frostbite kills
does this world make light of weaving
shrouds to bury
graves to fill?
I am just a kindred spirit
a runner who is running still

welcome to the longest mile
the most costly thing you will ever hold
wonderful is the journey
the greatest story ever told
the greatest story ever told
the greatest story ever told
the greatest story ever told
the greatest story ever

all my dreams are slowly dying
I can count my years in scars
the only one that has never left me
has carried me so very far
I have heard it said that he wastes nothing
so beautiful to behold
the Author of my hope is writing
the greatest story ever told

the greatest story ever told
the greatest story ever told
the greatest story ever told
the greatest story ever toldme oh my

there is something happening in the sky

I see my favorite face
it chokes me up so fiercely
and I am filled with your light
soaked with your grace
I will dance all night
I have got to say goodbye

there is something happening in the sky
me oh my!
I recall that I am yours now I am feeling fine
me oh my, you are mine

I sense a coming reign
a hand to hold the nations up in peace
the sun smiles down and warms our hearts
it is happening in the sky

there is something happening in the sky
me oh my!
I recall that I am yours now I am feeling fine
me oh my, you are mine

there is something happening in the sky
me oh my!
I recall that I am yours now I am feeling fine
me oh my, you are mineto the brothers and the sisters
to all of the resistors
all the workers broke and cryin’
on the road that leads to Zion:
the mountain, the mountain
we will all climb, all of God's children
in God's own time

unity the verb, hey solidarity
you the truth have heard, hey solidarity
rise up to the call, hey solidarity
united we can never fall
let one voice ring throughout the world
let truth be sown, let us lay our own lives down
a greater love was never

while the light is growing dim
make war to keep your faith in him
knowing what has made us free
unity, not uniformity
one world, one voice, in trenches we stand tall
one truth has found us
one shepherd for us all

unity the verb, hey solidarity
you the truth have heard, hey solidarity
rise up to the call, hey solidarity
united we can never fall
let one voice ring throughout the world
let truth be sown, let us lay our own lives down
a greater love was never known

hey solidarity

cruisin, downtown in your Camaro
REO Speedwagon on the stereo

cutting your hair like Billy Ray Cyrus

you are probably sad that the guy from Lynyrd Skynyrd died
you are probably singing "oh oh oh"
all night long

feel the power of the phantom mullet
tremble and cower from the phantom mullet
white metal burn of the phantom mullet
combed straight or permed it is the phantom mullet
and you, cutting it short on top
I want that for me
growing it long in the back
so savage and so free

drop into first you are taking it slow
you are such a rock star
you could never know
I wish I was singing "oh oh oh"
all night long

feel the power of the phantom mullet
tremble and cower from the phantom mullet
white metal burn of the phantom mullet
combed straight or permed it is the phantom mullet
and you, cutting it short on top

yeahI do not know just how this happened
I did not think it ever could
I am the author of sappy love songs
trading in my bachelorhood
something snapped deep inside me
something that somebody said
I felt the brush of angel's wings then
your voice echoed in my head

ugly day, sun is shining
every cloud has got a silver lining
ugly day, skies are blue
now every day is ugly without you

are the one pure thing
that I have always prayed for
scales are falling from my eyes
I must have been so blind before
I would lie down on the street
to keep the dust off of your feet
I would kneel each time I kissed you
anything, Christie I miss you

ugly day, the sun is shining
every cloud has got a silver lining
ugly day, skies are blue
now every day is ugly without you

whoa whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa 

today was an ugly one
just like all the others
all the flowers and the birds
making me feel smothered
I would lie down on the street
to keep the dust up off of your feet
I would kneel each time I kissed you
anything, Christie I miss you

ugly day, the sun is shining
every cloud has got a silver lining
ugly day, skies are blue
now every day is ugly without

ugly day, the sun is shining
Every cloud has got a silver lining
ugly day, skies are blue
now every day is ugly without you

I was in second grade
my first real record, yeah
worn down it played and played
young and blind
my double mind

when the world was black and white
watch me turn my back tonight
on Freddie Mercury
Mr. Fahrenheit

I was in eighth grade
I said he was a queer
I thought he had it coming
he died of AIDs that year
my liberty
like Christ's death meant nothing to me

when the world was black and white
watch me turn my back tonight
on Freddie Mercury
Mr. Fahrenheit

when my veins choked thick with spite
blind man's bluff burns in hindsight
for Freddie Mercury
Mr. Fahrenheit

predisposed to bigotry
the regular run-of-the-mill American story
the stench of greasepaint on our faces
pass the mask to our next of kin
instead of wiser idioms
like "love the sinner, hate the sin”

when the world was black and white
watch me turn my back tonight
on Freddie Mercury
Mr. Fahrenheit

when my veins choked thick with spite
blind man's bluff burns in hindsight
for Freddie Mercury
Mr. Fahrenheit

when the world was black and white
watch me turn my back tonight
on Freddie Mercury
Mr. Fahrenheit

I am sorry, so sorry
I am sorry, so sorry
I am sorry. I am sorry
so sorry, I am sorryhere the man draws the line for separation. (old vision.)
watch the man build up his walls for isolation. (you make division.)
walk no mile
I am sick and tired
all of the cowards at the radio station
no cathartic plot to thicken
to quote the vernacular
I would say that you are chicken

we are going nowhere
and it is happening fast
a dim future
and a darker past
somewhere away from here
from past mistakes they often learn
at Fahrenheit 451
you close your doors and let it burn

Pharisees in the church
time to take a vacation. (emancipation.)
Pharisees think the world comes to them for salvation. (booyah.)

we are going nowhere
and it is happening fast
a dim future
and a darker past
somewhere away from here
from past mistakes they often learn
at Fahrenheit 451
you close your doors and let it burn

the radio is preaching the candy coated good
the record companies and the TV too
no one rocks the boat
terrified of trouble
can not tamper with the walls of their sterile Christian bubble
it was never your point to get people saved
you pad yourself with fluff just because you are afraid
I am not afraid to point the finger now
the choir is so used to the preacher anyhow

we are going nowhere
and it is happening fast
a dim future
and a darker past
somewhere away from here
from past mistakes they often learn
at Fahrenheit 451
you close your doors and let it burn

yeah yeah yeahall right that is my kinda talk mister

well I heard that your state could be sinking
deep into the briny sea
and all of them earthquakes got you thinking
about leaving Californee
there is riots and there is floods and it is smoggy
toxic waste on yonder beach
and all of them Hippies down in Santa Cruz
are starting to suck just like a leach ("hey man")
you are sick of sunshine and surfing
you have had all the tofu you can take
well lookee here times a wasting
you just move to the Centennial state!

some people think our state is square
they are wrong just wait and see
I walk a mile high
Colorado's right for me

well riding on a cow can make you tired
and it gets a little cold (“that is true!")
but if y'all could use a little swaying
here is Val from the W's! (“hi.")

riding rodeos and square dancing
you farm like mad all day ("aaaaagh!")
you might think that I am lying
shoot listen to what my uncle has got to say!
“I am an old smelly geezer
I do not know what rhymes with that
if you have got a boil you can pick it
get out of my yard and give me my chicken!”

some people think our state is square
they are wrong just wait and see
I walk a mile high
Colorado's right for me

the sunlight is fading
the longest shadows have been cast
like songs from a siren
hurricanes from the past
and I am a failure
defeated every time
so let me lie here
a sidewalk for a shrine

I am so lonely
they say you were lonely too
dear God be my savior
I wait for you

my broken spirit
is trembling slow
park bench for a throne now
my blanket is the snow
and I am being haunted
by long forgotten dreams
for hurricanes have
the bluest eyes I have ever seen

I am so lonely
they say you were lonely too
dear God be my savior
I wait for you

I am pining for your mercy
for this storm to break
Lord you are my comfort
the hope for which I wait

dear God be my savior

I am so lonely
they say you were lonely too
dear God be my savior

I wait for you

I wait for you

I wait for you

for you

when no one looks the clouds come rolling in
and under darkened skies the buildings grow big teeth and eyes
they breathe and walk through unending doors
eating restaurants, and barber shops, and hardware stores
with catch phrases and jingles stealing steel and concrete lies
the corridors of Babylon are craning for the skies

who is behind the curtain anyway
who pulls the levers and tells the lies?
giants roam the land today
gaining dominance with every stride

boom
ha ha ha ha ha

oh do not you cry for the mom and pops
nothing but dry eyes for integrity's demise
hulking machines grind as whistles blow
corporate Darwinism crushes everything below
advances in efficiency increasing productivity
are narrowing the margin for liberty

who is behind the curtain anyway
who pulls the levers and tells the lies?
giants roam the land today
gaining dominance with every stride

"this house is haunted by the ghost of Adam Smith
the wealth of nations and the further death of innocence
to rule the world, the desire of every man
the earth is shaking, there are giants in the land.”

down with the giants
down with the giants
down with the giants
down with the giants

see the blood red sun is rising
on the broken carnage from the darkest days
giants locked together arm in arm
pushing all the meek out of the way

who is behind the curtain anyway
who pulls the levers and tells the lies?
giants roam the land today
gaining dominance with every stridepumpernickel

Larry married Mary now he has gone so far away
and I might go as far as to say that I
still like Larry, I still like Larry
I still like Larry anywayin the beginning was the hype
the loud fanfare as I grabbed the mic
suckah M.C.s stepped with no clout
do not quit your day job or your paper route
fantastic and so spastic
dope drop rhymes like sonic booms
that is the kind of hype that could clear this room

I got the hype so big, it is stacked so high
other M.C.s just stand and cry
Brad slapped your Mama, your Mama asked "why?"
when Brad says "hype", you do or die
implausible, impossible
we drop dope rhymes like sonic booms
that is the kind of hype that could clear this room

the packaging is nice

it is not unusual to be loved by anyone
it is not unusual to have fun with anyone
but when I see you hanging out with anyone
it is not unusual to see me cry
I wanna die

it is not unusual to go out for anytime
but when I see you hanging about, it is such a crime
if you should ever want to be loved by anyone
it is not unusual, it happens everyday
no matter what you say
you will find it happens all the time
love will never do
what you want it to
why can not this crazy love be mine?

it is not unusual to be mad with anyone
it is not unusual to be sad with anyone
if you should ever feel you have like changing your mind
it is not unusual to find that I am in love with you

owAmy's going back to school today
elation, jubilation
streams from her face
did the halls smell
of gunpowder still
what made the human mind
dark enough to kill

a new hope
where is your freedom
a new hope
cast off your burdens

a darker world lies behind this one
cryptic, it hides beneath perception
we all saw it on that day
stunned, we stood stuttering
what did the news say

a new hope
where is your freedom
a new hope
cast off your burdens

a new hope
where there is freedom
a new hope
here is your freedom

peace floods us by hope we steer
our dark hearts savaged we live without fear

peace floods us by hope we steer
our dark hearts savaged we live without fear

peace floods us by hope we steer
our dark hearts savaged we live without fear

and a new hope
where there is freedom
a new hope
cast off your burdens

a new hope
where there is freedom
a new hope
here is your freedom

hope
for all the deepest thoughts compiled
philosophy to laws of physics
no one has ever heard or seen
a more beautiful thing
than this love that saved us

in the soundless awe and wonder
words fall short to hope again
how beautiful
how vast your love is
new forever
world without an end

the very spark that burns the stars
drew near to me today
the God of everything that is
whispered in my ear that His love is boundless

in the soundless awe and wonder
words fall short to hope again
how beautiful
how vast Your Love is
new forever
world without an end

in the soundless awe and wonder
words fall short to hope again
