Denver, Colorado, the end is here. please welcome to the stage for the very last time, Five Iron Frenzy!

woo hoo

some cowboys were a ridin', ridin' on the range;
the grass was over grazed there, and spotted like some mange;
the buffalo were dead there, the trees they all were through
and if they saw some Injuns, why they would kill them too

west or bust, in God we trust, "let's rape, let's kill, let's steal"
we can almost justify, anything we feel;
I'm climbing up that ladder, more brownie points for me
I'll work my way to Jesus you wait and see

said one cowboy to another, "I think it would be nice
if we could take these injuns and convert them all to Christ;
see, they are all disgusting, and bringing me great pain
and if they do not believe me, we'll put a bullet in their brains!”

west or bust, in God we trust, "let's rape, let's kill, let's steal"
we can almost justify, anything we feel;
I'm climbing up that ladder, more brownie points for me
I'll work my way to Jesus you wait and see

I am always shoutin', when I go outside
how people should repent now, or they are going to die
my motives are all selfish, I'm a cannon brimmed with powder
if people do not believe me, I just beat them and yell louder

west or bust, in God we trust, "let's rape, let's kill, let's steal"
we can almost justify, anything we feel;
I'm climbing up that ladder, more brownie points for me
I'll work my way to Jesus you wait andyou found 
a way,
to draw 
a line between the world 
and you
faking your identity its true. did
you think the word "alternative"
was only meant for the likes of
you? 

do you think that they are too
cool now? being popular is lame
you are the one who made them popular
all their songs are still the same

you found them first, it made you
stand apart, you know? but then
everyone jumped on the same
bandwagon, making you and
average Joe. a lemming for the
mediocre, you were just a plain
old joker, status quo. blame it on
the band now. if you prick them
do they bleed? what's the point in
playing what they want, if you
won't let them succeed?

do you remember where we all
came from? do you remember
what it's all about? when you
made a point to be objective
before you started writing
handbook for the sellout?

yeah yeah yeah yeah 
yeah yeah yeah yeah

yeah yeah yeah yeah

you sunk your worth in being
different, just to be like your own
kind. you traded in objectiveness
for the underground you follow
blind

do you remember where we all
came from? do you remember
what it's all about? when you
made a point to be objective
before you started writing
handbook for the sellout?my car broke down in Arizona
have to ride the bus again
at ten-o-clock on Tuesday night
with thirteen cents and a broken pen
I put my backpack on the bench
tell two people I do not smoke
see the cop across the street
he thinks that I am selling dope

I could have walked another block
to get away from the scene
why does it always come to this
where zero meets fifteen?

and so I gave my thirteen cents
to the man who peed his pants
he passes out and falls on me
I watch my change fall from his hand
I see the lady next to me
holds her baby black blue
the junkie gutter-punks keeps asking
where I got my new tattoo

what does it matter anyway
thirteen cents or all I own?
how can I ever save the world
on cup-o-soup and student loans?

and

I want to try and save the world
but it never goes that way
God I do not know what to do
down at Colfax and Broadway

now the man with no shoes on
says I do not know how to play
he says I fumble all the time
he thinks that I am John Elway
I put my face down in my hands
water wells inside my eyes
what do I have to give them?
does it matter if I try?

I can’t stand to see you suffer
I try to intellectualize
a formula to end you pain
it doesn’t work
God knows I have tried

yes

I want to try and save the world
but it never goes that way
God I do not know what to do
down at Colfax and Broadway

sometimes my cup is overfilled
sometimes I’m too afraid that I am going to spill

and 

I want to try and save the world
but it never goes that way
God I do not know what to do
down at Colfax and Broadway

ugh

this is really surreal

you you know how in movies like people fake their death and then they go to their own funeral

it’s weird

it’s weird, we are the I’m looking out, and I’m seeing like, all these people, all the big fans from everywhere, this is so crazy

all I’m saying

all right, that’s it, I quit, this is it
this is as good as it gets 
I’m done 

how many of you guys have seen us on this tour?

all right, I’m sorry to announce that we didn’t change the set list up at all ‘cause we are too lazy 

and uh

also we were like 
should we make the last show 
should we change up
add some more songs
or do something crazy
but then we were like

no, no, it’s for us, so we are just gonna be lazy and then uh
I know you guys love Phillip
I hope you do not mind

wind passes right through my skin as I fall down, this furious speed will only destroy me
crippling and devastating momentum, approaching maximum velocity

and this is how it's going to be, the point of it all, 'cause this is what was meant for me, recklessly I fall

hulking, smashing, I come crashing, nothing like when I was small
I am unstoppable, I am the cannonball

thirty-two feet per second I increase, as the exponents will multiply
I'll never stop to look back behind me, cutting through the bright blue sky

and this is how it's meant to be, untethered I will soar
I'll barrel towards the earth below, it's what I was made for

hulking, smashing, I come crashing, nothing like when I was small
I am unstoppable, I am the cannonball
that feeble coward that you knew, has undergone an overhaul
I am unstoppable, I am the cannonball

and everyone will say it's just an accident, like some mishap or a tragedy
I think that failure has a purpose, and I do not believe its chance if I fall
and I know that if I ever do fall, he will catch me
and if he ever lets me fall down, for the good of those who believe him
he will make me into a cannonball

cannonball
cannonball
cannonball

unblemished, and faultless. a burning luminescence (cannonball)
unequaled precision, beyond your scope of vision (cannonball)

my sister and I in the back seat just wait
we pass the time by making lines in the seat that we can't cross
a thin line like dental floss

she threw my new blue comb out the window, somewhere on I-70
dad said, "I'm sorry, but we can't go back,"
we are never going back to get it
it was the first comb I ever had
got it just that morning from my mom and my dad
light blue in color, I could never have another
comb like that, big and fat…

so tell me, have you seen my comb?
last time I saw it, it was in her hands
and then it was bouncing down the road
it wasn't fancy, it wasn't brown
but now it might be from lying on the ground
so tell me, have you seen my comb?

driving down the road in September
I was only five but I still remember
where the highway turns at the bottom of the hill
my parents both up front 'cause they loved each other still
an ordinary comb made of plastic
an action of a sibling lacking couth
it wasn’t just a comb out that window
it was the last great symbol of my youth

have you seen my comb?
last time I saw it, it was in her hands
and then it was bouncing down the road
it wasn't fancy, it wasn't brown
but now it might be from lying on the ground
so tell me, have you seen my comb?



yes

does it sound alright out there
that’s because of Saki
Saki is a ninja
oh you must scoot back

oh what?
you found my comb?
boy I never heard that one

thank you

tomorrow morning

when I’m sleeping in until like
noon 
I’m gonna be like
no more combs

I have got about ten thousand combs at home

if you only knew how many times 
we’d wished we’d named that
have you seen my dollar
we just
we failed

so uh
yeah I’m feeling pretty old, Dennis

I do not know about you

yet shaking my fists in defiance

anyway, I'm not cliche
I hardly own any ties
I may be old
but at least I'm not like all those other old guys

I'm watching MTV for fashion tips
so I can say that I saw it first
backwards hat, tattoos, and goatee;
say I'm cool
just like Fred Durst
I pay almost all my bills
I sleep on a futon still

anyway, I'm not cliche
I hardly own any ties
I may be old
but at least I'm not like all those other old guys

I may be old

I have got pocketfuls of crumpled receipts
just about enough to start a fire
I'll watch the past just burn away
put the mic stand through the amplifier 
yeah

put the bass down, bass down, one time
snap the neck now. drum set, smash it
kick the kick drum, one time, kicked in
smashed up, break it, break up

see the flames begin to crawl, upward
taste the anguish as they fall, unheard

cancellation! devastation! deviation! expiration!
cancellation! devastation! deviation! expiration!

I have got notebooks full of misshapen words
I'll never speak them anymore

put the guitar, guitar, one time
through the speaker, splintered, broken
throw the horns down, one time, horns down
smash them, break them, break up

see the flames begin to crawl, upward
taste the anguish as they fall, unheard
hear the record start to skip, unsung
feel the weight that sunk the ship, so young

the crowds recoil, demand our survival
fists in the air, mouths caked with saliva
but you are the one, the spark that was spawned
who picks up the pieces, and passes it on

see the flames begin to crawl, upward
taste the anguish as they fall, unheard
hear the record start to skip, unsung
feel the weight that sunk the ship, so youngwatching Mrs. Brady prime the brand new Kenmore washer
see the brilliant gleam of the automatic tooth flosser
beautiful new china, what a lovely cup and saucer
yeah I saw your Rolex, but I think it's an impostor

my teeth are getting yellow from the mocha I just drank
I need to bleach them out, but my breath will still be rank
did you you see the new computers, aren't they oh so obsolete?
and that shade of black you wear, it's so Tuesday of last week
you need a better life

I used to be an amateur but now I'm going pro
It once was Mile High but you sold it to Invesco

beneath the golden arches
somewhere in Japan

vultures circling
open, swallow
you are so hollow
yeah

and the vultures circle
they have paved the way
they have bit and clawed their paths
to top floors in L.A
and beneath the brazen windows
you can hear the sound
they say the word on the street
Is "something's going down”...

oh I gotta remember to say hi to this guy

and I gotta say thanks to this guy

and then I can’t talk and I feel like an idiot

this song is uh

it’s for all of you

it’s entitled “you can’t handle this”

making young girls pine
I do not have the time
babies get in line
I have got a protractor
got a stapler now
it goes "Ka-ching"
gotta have the math club
crown me king
gotta rock the screen
with the cosine graphing
on my calculator

if you are up and if you want
a piece of me
wave goodbye and blow a kiss
'cause you can't handle this

no, no, no
you can't handle this
no, no, no
you can't handle this

through my glasses glare
you'll see savoir faire
beneath my icy stare
I have got a retainer
maybe I'm the physics main event
maybe I'm the chem club president
maybe even Texas Instruments
thinks that I'm co-planar

if you are up and if you want
a piece of me
wave goodbye and blow a kiss
'cause you can't handle this

no, no, no
you can't handle this
no, no, no
you can't handle this

and Leonard Nimoy can't stand up to this
and Captain James T. Kirk
bows beneath my fists
and I am awesome awesome

my voice is coming back this is good
this is getting right

all right uh 

this song is uh

it’s dedicated to anybody that remembers the band that the three of us were in before, Exhumator

especially that one guy that was in it

I know you are embarrassed Scott, but I love ya

this is a false metal song it’s called “American kryptonite”

American kryptonite

yeah

uh

he is the icon of our times, solution to our modern crimes
his trigger finger clicks remotes, as carbohydrates slowly bloat

not fragile, or brittle. he's seeking an acquittal
no scruples, no meekness, he has but one great weakness

all the world must have a price
save yourself from sacrifice
everything will end alright
American kryptonite

his mighty hands will hardly fail, his intellect is barely frail
he moves his lips in perfect sync, demanding an espresso drink
with passion, he searches, he'll make another purchase
familiar you know him, he's saying that you owe him

all the world must have a price
save yourself from sacrifice
everything will end alright
American kryptonite

it was like the manifest destiny all over again, except
instead of taking and consuming everything in their paths for God
they did so with the same fervor
and sense of entitlement for their new god...themselves

buy, take, break, throw it away
buy, take, break, throw it away
buy, take, break, throw it away
buy, take, break, throw it away

buy, take, break, throw it away

throw it away
throw it away
throw it away
throw it away

all the world must have a price
save yourself from sacrifice
everything will end alright

beautiful day
wonderful feeling
I feel like singing
Psalms meaning songs singing praises all day long
joy fills the weak
joy makes us strong
filled till we burst
songs of praise to the God of the Universe

despite our selfish selves
despite all loss of hope
despite our lack of faith
despite our stony hearts
despite the waning moon
despite the ebbing tide of how we think this world should be

praise God from whom all blessings flow
praise Him all creatures here below
praise Him above ye heavenly host
praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost

gray rainy day, down in the mud for us
do not feel I can sing
songs to the God in control of the seasons
but what's good and bad
flow from the hands
of the God with the perfect plan
filling us with joy, all of this will glorify

despite our selfish selves
despite all loss of hope
despite our lack of faith
despite our stony hearts
despite the waning moon
despite the ebbing tide of how we think this world should be

praise God from whom all blessings flow
praise Him all creatures here below
praise Him above ye heavenly host
praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost

a song sung for underdogs
for all the left out
a flag flying for losers
somewhere in the Heavens
the God of ever-lasting comfort
believed in me
loved me when I was faithless
he still died for me

she is strong but never silent
sure of where her strength comes from.,
one day, one girl army will overcome

she is strong but never silent
sure of where her strength comes from.,
one day, one girl army will overcome

my evil plan to save the world
just you wait till it's unfurled
it'll go down in history
it's prophetic, no it's not pathetic
I can't believe I made it up myself

my evil plan to save the world
just you wait till it's unfurled
it'll go down in history
it's prophetic, no it's not pathetic
I can't believe I made it up myself

yeah

sometimes when we touch
the honesty's too much
and I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you till I die
till we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides

sometimes when we touch
the honesty's too much
and I have to close my eyes and hide
I wanna hold you till I die
till we both break down and cry
I wanna hold you till the fear in me subsides

pre-ex-girlfriend, that girl is just too fine
pre-ex-girlfriend, leaving me behind

yeah

so uh

we have got three songs left 

this song’s about Columbine high school

more importantly it’s about something that uh I think I think we all lack and it came across very clear that day. It’s just that we all need something solid to hope for, beyond material things and I think that I think that everyone can find that in the love of Jesus Christ uh

so that’s what this song is about 

I hope you hate itAmy's going back to school today
elation, jubilation
streams from her face
did the halls smell
of gunpowder still
what made the human mind
dark enough to kill

a new hope
where there is freedom
a new hope
cast off your burdens

a darker world lies behind this one
cryptic, it hides beneath perception
we all saw it on that day
stunned, we stood stuttering
what did the news say

a new hope
where there is freedom
a new hope
cast off your burdens

a new hope
here is your freedom
a new hope
here is your freedom

peace floods us by hope we steer
our dark hearts salvaged we live without fear

peace floods us by hope we steer
our dark hearts salvaged we live without fear

peace floods us by hope we steer
our dark hearts salvaged we live without fear

and 
a new hope
where there is freedom
a new hope
cast off your burdens

a new hope
here is your freedom
a new hope
here is your freedom

hope

hope is freedomfor all the deepest thoughts compiled
philosophy to laws of physics
no one's ever heard or seen
a more beautiful thing
than this love that saved us

in the soundless awe and wonder
words fall short to hope again
how beautiful
how vast your love is
new forever
world without an end

the very spark that burns the stars
drew near to me today
the God of everything that is
whispered in my ear that His love is boundless

in the soundless awe and wonder
words fall short to hope again
how beautiful
how vast Your Love is
new forever
world without an end

we love you guys

in the soundless awe and wonder
words fall short to hope again
how beautiful
how vast Your Love is
new forever
world without an

in the soundless awe and wonder
words fall short to hope again
how beautiful
how vast Your Love is
new forever
world without an

in the soundless awe and wonder
words fall short to hope again
how beautiful
how vast Your Love is
new forever
world without an

in the soundless awe and wonder
words fall short to hope again
how beautiful
how vast Your Love is
new forever
world without an end

thanks you guys

FIF FIF FIF FIF FIF FIF FIF FIF FIF FIF FIF FIF FIF FIF FIF FIF FIF FIF FIF FIF FIF FIF FIF FIF

that’s good

thank you

thanks you guys

you guys are gonna make it hard to sing, I’m just gonna be blubbering into the microphone 

yeah

this is uh

you guys know what this song is 
we always play it last
it’s called every new daywhen I was young, the smallest trick of light
could catch my eye
then life was new and every new day
I thought that I could fly
I believed in what I hoped for
and I hoped for things unseen
I had wings and dreams could soar
I just do not feel like flying anymore

when the stars threw down their spears
watered Heaven with their tears
before words were spoken
before eternity

dear Father, I need you
Your strength my heart to mend
I want to fly higher
every new day again

when I was small, the furthest I could reach
was not so high
then I thought the world was so much smaller
feeling that I could fly
through distant deeps and skies
behind infinity
below the face of Heaven
He stoops to create me

dear Father, I need you
Your strength my heart to mend
I want to fly higher
every new day again

you are not alone
you are not alone
you are not alone
you are never alone
man versus himself
man versus machine
man versus the world
mankind versus me
the struggles go on
the wisdom I lack
the burdens keep piling
up on my back
so hard to breathe
to take the next step
the mountain is high
I wait in the depths
yearning for grace
and hoping for peace
dear God
increase

healing hands of God have mercy on our unclean souls once again
Jesus Christ, light of the world burning bright within our hearts forever
freedom means love without condition, without a beginning or an end
here's my heart, let it be forever yours
only you can make every new day seem so new

hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah

hallelujah
hallelujah
hallelujah

thank you thank you thank you 
thank you thank you thank you 
thank you thank you thank you 
thank you thank you thank you 
thank you thank you thank you 
thank you thank you thank you 
thank you thank you thank you 
thank you thank you thank you 
thank you thank you thank you 
thank you thank you thank you

amazing grace 
how sweet the sound
that saved a wretch like me

I once was lost
but now am found
was blind but now I see

twas grace that taught my heart to fear
and grace my fears relieved
how precious did that grace
the hour I first believed

when we have been there
ten thousand years
bright shining as the sun
we have no less days 
to sing God’s praise
than when we’d first begun

amazing grace
how sweet the sound
that saved a wretch like me

I once was lost
but now am found
was blind but now I see


oh God some of us wouldn’t know that grace that song talks unless it was for Five Iron, and thank You for them, and thank You for for them showing us that Grace and that love

all of us have been blessed by them them, that’s why we are here

and Father

God I know that so many other people are gonna be blessed and so many people younger than us and maybe even the next generation, God

thank You so much for them and and their willingness to be Your servants and and the and your vessel God

whew

thank you

thank you Jesus

the Oglalas

there’s an Oglala Sioux chief who was named Sitting Bull, before the battle of Little Big Horn, he turned to some of his some of his chiefs, and he said “today is a good day to die.”

today is a good day to die.

in the Bible there’s a story of the prophet Elijah

at the end of his, his life, he he takes off his cloak and he hands it down to his the person that he has taught his whole life, Elisha, he gives him his cloak, with a blessing, to carry twice twice the grace that he has been given, twice the faith, that he would do twice as much, so tonight, this is what is happening to you. we are passing this mantle down

do good things with it

remember that that God loves you

remember that all he requires of you is to love him with all your heart
and to love others as yourself

we are gonna sing one more song
and then uh
you guys can go home

hopefully see some of you tomorrow

we’ll see you around though one day anyway

this might seems stupid 

but it’s snowing outside

so I’m gonna sing this song

silent night

holy night

all is calm

all is bright

round yon Virgin, mother and child
holy infant, so tender and mild
sleep in heavenly peace
sleep in heavenly peace

one more time

silent night
holy night
all is calm
all is bright
round yon Virgin mother and child
holy infant so tender and mild
sleep in heavenly peace
sleep in heavenly peace

Godspeed
