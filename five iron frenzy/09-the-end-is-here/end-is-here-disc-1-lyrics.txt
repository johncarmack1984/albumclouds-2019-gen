wind passes right through my skin as I fall down, this furious speed will only destroy me
crippling and devastating momentum, approaching maximum velocity
and this is how it's going to be, the point of it all, 'cause this is what was meant for me, recklessly I fall

hulking, smashing, I come crashing, nothing like when I was small
I am unstoppable, I am the cannonball

thirty-two feet per second I increase, as the exponents will multiply
I'll never stop to look back behind me, cutting through the bright blue sky
and this is how it's meant to be, untethered I will soar
I'll barrel towards the earth below, it's what I was made for


hulking, smashing, I come crashing, nothing like when I was small
I am unstoppable, I am the cannonball
that feeble coward that you knew, has undergone an overhaul
I am unstoppable, I am the cannonball

and everyone will say it's just an accident, like some mishap or a tragedy
I think that failure has a purpose, and I do not believe its chance if I fall
and I know that if I ever do fall, he will catch me
and if he ever lets me fall down, for the good of those who believe him
he will make me into a cannonball
cannonball
cannonball
cannonball

unblemished, and faultless. a burning luminescence (cannonball)
unequaled precision, beyond your scope of vision (cannonball)

I'm twenty-nine years old
still wearing the wallet chain
like I was twenty-eight
I'm wearing my vans right now
so high school kids
will think that I can skate
I have got a degree in science
yet shaking my fists in defiance

anyway, I'm not cliche
I hardly own any ties
I may be old
but at least I'm not like all those other old guys

I'm watching MTV for fashion tips
so I can say that I saw it first
backwards hat, tattoos, and goatee;
say I'm cool
just like Fred Durst
I pay almost all my bills
I sleep on a futon still

anyway, I'm not cliche
I hardly own any ties
I may be old
but at least I'm not like all those other old guys

I may be old
but at least I'm not like all those other old guyswe thought we'd write a song about all the problems inherent in the industry
it was going to be an expose written in unblemished symmetry
we were going to have our glorious exit, an admonition and an encore
we were going to make a point to the whole world
but no one wants to hear it anymore

do not worry what this song would say, you'll never hear it anyway
they won't play this song on the radio
so far, so bad, that's how it goes
they'll pull our records from the shelves
so far, so bad, that's how it goes

the rhyme scheme to this song was mostly flawless
it might have made good poetry
it could have bridged the gap between the classes
and overthrown the bourgeoisie 
it made a couple points about the future
and how the past was kind of uncool
and if you ever tried to play it backwards
it told the kids to stay in school

do not worry what this song would say, you'll never hear it anyway
they won't play this song on the radio
so far, so bad, that's how it goes
they'll pull our records from the shelves
so far, so bad, that's how it goes

I thought i'd write an epiphany, how something good is changing me
but i guess we dodged some passing fad
it looks like its so far, so bad. 
so bad
this song is rad. 
uh you could ask your dad. 
he won't be mad. this song is stupid!

they won't play this song on the radio
so far, so bad, that's how it goes
they'll pull our records from the shelves
so far, so bad, that's how it goesit's new year's eve and I'm full of empty promises
I half pretend to keep this time
just like last year

the band is loud and I'm wandering the shadows
wishing I was never here
I persevere

a crowded room
these whitewashed tombs
they raise their glasses high
they kiss the past goodbye

this new year's eve, I'm waiting for tomorrow
my heart is on my sleeve, and yes I still believe
this new year's eve, will turn out better than before
I'm holding on, still holding out
until they close the door... on me

it's new year's eve and I feel my insecurities
are haunting me like ghosts, this sinking quicksand
and then with thunderous praise and lofty adoration
a second passes by, yet nothing changes

I hate my skin
this grave I'm standing in
another change of years
and I wish I wasn't here

this new year's eve, I'm waiting for tomorrow
my heart is on my sleeve, and yes I still believe
this new year's eve, will turn out better than before
I'm holding on, still holding out
until they close the door... on me

a year goes by and I'm staring at my watch again
and I dig deep this time
tor something greater than I have ever been
fife to ancient wineskins. And I was blind but now I see

this new year's eve, something must change me inside
I'm crooked and misguided, and tired of being tired

this new year's eve, I'm waiting for tomorrow
my heart is on my sleeve, and yes I still believe, in You

yeah 

in YouAmerican kryptonite

yeah

he is the icon of our times, solution to our modern crimes
his trigger finger clicks remotes, as carbohydrates slowly bloat

not fragile, or brittle. he's seeking an acquittal
no scruples, no meekness, he has but one great weakness

all the world must have a price
save yourself from sacrifice
everything will end alright
American kryptonite

his might hands will hardly fail, his intellect is barely frail
he moves his lips in perfect sync, demanding an espresso drink
with passion, he searches, he'll make another purchase
familiar you know him, he's saying that you owe him

all the world must have a price
save yourself from sacrifice
everything will end alright
American kryptonite

it was like the manifest destiny all over again, except
instead of taking and consuming everything in their paths for God
they did so with the same fervor
and sense of entitlement for their new god...themselves

buy, take, break, throw it away
buy, take, break, throw it away
buy, take, break, throw it away
buy, take, break, throw it away

buy, take, break, throw it away

throw it away
throw it away
throw it away
throw it away

all the world must have a price
save yourself from sacrifice
everything will end alright
American kryptonitewe flew over Alaska;
we saw the frozen mountains pierce the clouds
it was beautiful
we felt the waves of new Zealand;
the water shimmered beneath a moonlight shroud
it was beautiful

close to home in an ordinary room
we felt You there
it's my favorite memory
You are so beautiful

the spring in Appalachia
with flowers swaying above the fields of green
it was beautiful
driving in new England
the road littered with bright October leaves
it was beautiful

close to home in an ordinary room
we felt You there
it's my favorite memory
You are so beautiful to me
thanks for the songs
these seven friends and eight good years
it is You that made them sweet
it was beautiful

pictures looking back
just snapshots of the past cannot compare
to feeling what we felt
through anything that came
that You were there

a thousand smiling faces
backlit and bouncing to the beat
it was beautiful
as many soaring voices
forever changed by Your mercy
it was beautiful

far away from all the lights and noise
we felt You there
it's my favorite memory
You are so beautiful to me

thanks for the songs
these seven friends
and eight good years
it is You that made them sweet
You are so beautiful to mewizard needs food, badly

I know that you are probably mad at me
I have come to expect that
you know that you'll never have all of me
you have come to resent that
you say "tomato", I say "video games"
you are acting so solemn
you'll take the precious remote control from me
do I sound like Gollum?
not that I'm escaping
you charm me like the flame does moths
it's just that you'd prefer me docile
like a narcoleptic sloth

the wizard needs food badly
the Voltron can't be incomplete
the things I love, you hate so madly
I must not go down in defeat

In the hunter-gatherer societies
I'd bring home the bacon
Public thought says men should try and be tame
Stirred but not shaken
I say "baseball" then you start to cry
I'm sorry I grieve you
I think a motorcycle's a good way to die
This must bereave you

I know that you try so hard
And I'm not saying it's a sin
It's just that they do not feel my pain
In Vogue or Cosmopolitan

the wizard needs food badly
the Voltron can't be incomplete
the things I love, you hate so madly
I must not go down in defeat

and I'm sure you have your reasons
but listen to me please…

I want the G.I. Joe with the Kung-Fu action grip
I want Nintendo with the extra-graphics-microchip
tackle football with rocks, and sticks, and knives, and pain
I want the truck with the four wheel drive train
you'd rather see me get good at bookkeepping
I could clean house in the time that I'm not sleeping
I live to serve you, and I do not want to be rude
but you should see that the wizard needs food

the wizard needs food badly
the Voltron can't be incomplete
the things I love, you hate so madly
I must not go down in defeat

wizard is about to dieyou said, "down with the church", with your fists up in the air
all the rancor and the hate, yeah we saw your frigid stare
you hate Christianity, but love your animosity
it's the church who's getting rotten, yet it's Christ that you have forgotten

goodnight, goodbye, farewell to arms, it's time
goodnight, goodbye, farewell to arms, it's time

lay down your hate, (the burden and) the weight will disappear
if you could separate your anger, from that still small voice you hear

clench your fists and grit your teeth, save forgiveness for the weak
let your bitterness consume, let the salt rub in your wounds
you have saved up all your spite, stoked the flame that keeps the fight
it's so hard to be objective, when your reason is defective

goodnight, goodbye, farewell to arms, it's time
goodnight, goodbye, farewell to arms, it's time

lay down your hate, (the burden and) the weight will disappear
if you could separate your anger, from that still small voice you hear

you say that you have aged, I think you are just enraged
you say that you have aged, I think you are just enraged

goodnight, goodbye, farewell to arms, it's time
goodnight, goodbye, farewell to arms, it's time

Who incited, what ignited, all this hatred, say farewell to arms
(Goodnight, goodbye, farewell to arms, it's time.)
Broken hearted, dearly departed, maybe we should say farewell to arms
(Goodnight, goodbye, farewell to arms, it's time.)it’s been a long time...

cancellation! devastation! deviation! expiration!
cancellation! devastation! deviation! expiration!

I have got pocketfuls of crumpled receipts
just about enough to start a fire
I'll watch the past just burn away
put the mic stand through the amplifier
put the bass down, bass down, one time
snap the neck now. drum set, smash it
kick the kick drum, one time, kicked in
smashed up, break it, break up

see the flames begin to crawl, upward
taste the anguish as they fall, unheard

cancellation! devastation! deviation! expiration!

I have got notebooks full of misshapen words
I'll never speak them anymore
ten years from now, you won't know my name
throw the microphone down on the floor
yeah 

put the guitar, guitar, one time
through the speaker, splintered, broken
throw the horns down, one time, horns down
smash them, break them, break up

see the flames begin to crawl, upward
taste the anguish as they fall, unheard
hear the record start to skip, unsung
feel the weight that sunk the ship, so young

the crowds recoil, demand our survival
fists in the air, mouths caked with saliva
but you are the one, the spark that was spawned
who picks up the pieces, and passes it on

see the flames begin to crawl, upward
taste the anguish as they fall, unheard
hear the record start to skip, unsung
feel the weight that sunk the ship, so youngan idea dies, in the same slight way
that we lose track of the facts
slowly, unseen, slipping silently
through some fabricated cracks
and now the freedom of the press
has turned to freedom to impress
perfect hair, sells product well
like suffocating, sickly smells
the make-up smears, like false pastels
like glossy, sugarcoated, shells

tune in, tune out, goodbye, goodnight
they are buying you with fear and lies
turn it off until it's right
that's the news, that's all, goodnight
turn it off until it's right
that's the news, that's all, goodnight

the advertising dollars buy
the right to stifle antonyms
to sterilize the truth with fiction
so we can sing their corporate hymns

and all of us were cowed and bought it
hardly anybody got it
while mergers made their spires grow taller
what they let you know grew smaller
and we were scared, or too bemused
and so we still turned on the news

tune in, tune out, goodbye, goodnight
they are buying you with fear and lies
turn it off until it's right
that's the news, that's all, goodnight
turn it off until it's right
that's the news, that's all


are you afraid yet?
they want you to be
it will keep you coming back
you are a loyal customer
are you afraid yet?
you should be

tune in, tune out, goodbye, goodnight
they are buying you with fear and lies
turn it off until it's right
that's the news, that's all, goodnight
turn it off until it's right
that's the news, that's all

goodnight
people say they know a girl
who's lost her way, she's always angry
no one bothers to ask her
what she hears or what she hopes for
the air is cold, she lives alone
and tires of being her only provider
she can't fathom grace tonight
so not tonight, it's not an option

searching for more than mere tastes of living water
tired eyes tend to wander, seek the light

create in her a sense of awe that sees Your beauty
let Your splendor flash with blinding light

cities slowly suffocate
what once was bright is now moth-eaten
as young girls filter thoughts that once were
fresh now worn and beaten
clutching pity like a prize
to her side her fingers grow weary
he cares so much for sparrows
won't He toss something out my way?

searching for more than mere lies disguised as dogma
tired eyes tend to wander, seek the light

create in her a sense of awe that sees Your beauty
let Your splendor flash with blinding light
standing tall, all the aspen trees drink water
as rain falls down like laughter from the sky

create in her a sense of awe that sees Your beauty
let Your splendor flash with blinding light
standing tall, all the aspen trees drink water
as rain falls down like laughter from the skysdneirf tseb eht ekam yeht sehciwdnas

once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary
suddenly there came a tapping, as of someone gently rapping
long ago I heard that sound, often lost, but seldom found
a haunting voice from minutes past, Micah had returned at last

and I was like, "what's up dude?"
and he was like, "uhhh, I found your comb."
and then I was like, “shut up!"
and then he was like, "yeah, and stuff."
and then I was like, "rock on!"

and that's how the story ends
now you’ll hear the score my friends
we are finding answers, we are setting trends
I guess that's how the story ends

how distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December
and each dying ember, wrought its ghost upon the floor
I heard a voice that chilled my spine, I saw what I could not define
a sight I never could contrive, there stood Brad at last, alive
"where have you been these endless years?"
I asked him, sobbing through my tears
"I did not die by plague or prison
what really died is cynicism."

and then I said, "awesome."
and he was like, "yeah, I guess
and by the way, those pants, they belong to my dad
and they are not really pants, they are leiderhosen." hooray!

and that's how the story ends
now you’ll hear the score my friends
we are finding answers, we are setting trends
I guess that's how the story ends

and Combat Chuck has passed away
his dying wish was "never play that song again"
and kitty-doggy's put to sleep, the dinosaurs lay in a heap
as they slowly go extinct, like me

and that's how the story ends
now you’ll hear the score my friends
we are finding answers, we are setting trends
I guess that's how the story ends
I have been scarred so deep by life and cold despair
and brittle bones were broken far beyond repair
I have leveled lies so deep, the truth may never find
and inside my faithless heart, I stole things never mine

if mercy falls upon the broken and the poor
dear Father, I will see You, there on distant shores

I have toiled for countless years and ever felt the cost
and I have been burned by this world's cold
like leaves beneath the frost
on my knees I have crawled to You, bleeding myself dry
but the price of life is more, than I could ever buy

if mercy falls upon the broken and the poor
dear Father, I will see You, there on distant shores

and off of the blocks, I was headstrong and proud
at the front of the line for the card-carrying, highbrowed
with both eyes fastened tight, yet unscarred from the fight
running at full tilt, my sword pulled from its hilt
it's funny how these things can slip away, our frail deeds
the last will wave good-bye
it's funny how the hope will bleed away
the citadels we build and fortify. good-bye

night came and I broke my stride
I swallowed hard, but never cried
when grace was easy to forget
I'd denounce the hypocrites
casting first stones, killing my own
and You would unscale my blind eyes
and I stood battered, but more wise
fighting to accelerate
shaking free from crippling weight
with resilience unsurpassed
I clawed my way to You at last
and on my knees, I wept at Your feet
I finally believed, that You still loved me

healing hands of God
have mercy on our unclean souls once again
Jesus Christ, Light of the World
burning bright within our hearts forever
freedom means love without condition
without beginning or an end
here's my heart, let it be forever Yours
only You can make every new day seem so new

what they can do is better

this is good, this is better

one misstep can make you stumble
you set yourself up for a fall
you punish yourself for each failure
dogma beat out alcohol
when all of your principles were fashioned
you thought your new rules made you new
but maybe those X's on your hands are what's killing you

the cross of Saint Andrew never meant to
take his place
the cross of Saint Andrew echoes of his
grace

good Saint Andrew knew the measure
he knew the cost of sacrifice
he left all that he knew behind him
great things comes at such great price
but all of this never bought the answers
obedience comes with controversy
what changed him changes me today
Christ has mercy

the cross of Saint Andrew never meant to
take his place
the cross of Saint Andrew echoes of his
grace

and
all your sins can be forgiven
all of this was always free
Jesus loves without condition
this is what freedom means to me

nihil ergo nunc damnationis
est his qui sunt in Christo lesu
qui non secundum carnem
ambulant

the cross of Saint Andrew never meant to
take his place
the cross of Saint Andrew echoes of his
grace

the cross of Saint Andrew never meant to
take his place
the cross of Saint Andrew echoes of his
grace

I have so many different emotions running through right now

kids are like what’d you drink, what’d you drink , some some anti-freeze, what what is that mercury, you drank a whole thermometer okay well here ah well that call for quantity is job one and then they just pop it in and the kid up in second, explosive vomit

oh well that’s encouraging, that’s almost like penicillin 

oh yeah
 
yeah
yeah it’s just

yeah I feel really important right now kids

yeah and we are we are like the Louis Pasteur of the rock world

yes 

yeah, everybody’s like “what? I didn’t pay attention to that part in school” 

we uh, this is like our third time playing downtown, but it’s not, we played in St. Paul once downtown, but not, here, it’s exciting

that’s when you drank ketchup onstage

yeah, I drank some ketchup and I vomited

all right kids, we are not gonna talk about any more stomach pumping or anything like that for the rest of the night, we apologize, uh, instead we are just gonna play some music 

and uh

you know I’m embarrassed, my mom taught me better, and I, I really should know better, so uh we are gonna do a new, and this is off our new record, it’s called cannonball

and it’s called bilging

Canada loves you

that’s not a question

Canada loves you is not a question

are you insulting the Canadian educational system? 

okay for the Canadians, uh, this is a question, okay, you with a ninja headband

why do not we come to Alaska more often?

okay well, this is how it works out, like if we, when we first started, we’d be like, we, you, we’d be like, “we want to play a show” and so then we’d call around and we’d be like, we’d call promoters and we’d be like “can we play a show there” and then they’d usually say no but every once in awhile they they would say yes, but then, uh, as you progress as a band you get to a point where you do not do that anymore then promoters call you and then they are like hey can my band come and then you get a booking agent and then they call that guy and so then you get you get then then we we just do what they tell us. the guys from Alaska call and we are like “hey come send Five Iron in” and then we are like “how much” and they are like “two hundred dollars” and then we are like “we can’t even ride a dog sled for that cheap” so that’s what happens and so then no one no one calls and books us in Alaska. we have played there three times though. 

you did? in Anchorage? that’s awesome, that’s praise the Lord, okay, wait, I gotta get somebody over here, uh, you, young lady?

whose pants are those anyway?

whose pants are those anyway? Brad, would you like to answer this question?

they are liederhosen

they are Bobby’s 

Brad’s dad’s

they weren’t really pants

no, Brad, it’s you

it is me?

I do not know, you wrote it

they are actually your dad’s pants and they are not really pants, they were liederhosen

it’s it’s on our new album, we tried to tie everything together, tried to answer all of your questions on there

uh, how about this guy with the blue thing

oh I guess everybody has those 

how much do you love us

how much do we love you

this much

yeah

the dude with the sock for the hand

what

how much do you weigh

how much do I weigh or how much do we weigh as a unit?

the question is how much did we weigh when we started the band and how much more do we weigh now 

yeah, it’s about two hundred more pounds

he hehe

I once had a physics teacher who gave me the stage the stageplot for the band the Ramones, and we had to find the center of mass of the stage of the Ramones. He told us all their individual weights, it was kind of cool.

Joey Ramone weighed like twenty-seven pounds, without his leather jacket, and like six hundred pounds with his jacket on

so Reese, how much do you weigh?

I weight a hundred and ninety eight pounds

oh okay

another one uh

we gotta ask more girls, more girs, there any girls,

well how about this girl right here with the glasses

what’s that? 

oh we can’t, we didn’t practice it

yeah, we are not very good, I do not know if they told you that

didn’t they tell you that when you were buying tickets, that like, “Five Iron Frenzy, not very good” yeah

you can do it

um

this song is about

it’s about a place, I I really I really feel
feel connected to, because we drove through there the other day

it’s part of North Dakota

it’s called Canada

yeah

so uh we are breaking up

yeah

no so listen

the problem

the problem is that so many people feel like us breaking up is like us dying, and I want to challenge you to think about this differently, it’s not like we are dying, it’s like we are your favorite pet and you are taking us out to be put to sleep

now listen, now listen, just, just imagine that you have a little weiner dog and we’ll say this weiner dog’s name is Izzy, and you just love this dog so much, and, you are taking this poor poor little dog that you love and and you know, weiner dogs, after awhile, their backs all break, carrying that immense weight, and so you just take this poor dog and you love it, and you are like “I love you, I love you, get in the car, and then you take the poor poor puppy down to the vet, and “I love you little puppy” and then he’s sitting in the the in the waiting room and you are just reading Highlights for children and like “I love you, we are just gonna go in to see the nice man in the white coat” he’s just, you go in there and you put the dog up on the thing and you are like “I love you, I love you, little doggy,” and then and then he just like and the vet is like “make peace with the dog, and dog, you make peace with baby Jesus, and then, you know, and then he and then you are like “okay, I love you” and then, and then the vet just slowly turns, slowly, with the syringe full of sodium penethol, jamming it into the dog’s neck, squeezing, the dog, slowly, clawing at the air, and then finally at last, sleep

see

yeah

wow

that’s all

that makes it much easier

you just you are just puttin’ him to sleep

so this song’s about that it’s called “see the flames begin to crawl”

there’s uh

you know I do not wanna offend anybody with this but this next song is about people who live an alternate lifestyle an alternative lifestyle that is not really accepted by the the rest of of America, and uh I just want to salute those people because, I know a lot of people think that what they are doing is wrong, but you know, I think it’s okay to cut your hair short in the front and grow it long in the back 

yeah

I think it’s totally okay and that

hey uh

if it’s on a weekend you do not get a day off, dude

you know what I wanna spend speak about a government conspiracy while we are on the subject and um something that Five Iron has taken under our wings is to uh kind of further the uh the the I do not know the lesser known uh political struggles in this world, and uh we just uh try and bring them to light

and uh down in Mexico there is something going on that is really pretty scary, and that is people are being forced to eat mayonnaise tacos, and this is a crying shame, um, I do not know if you guys could write your congressman or something, but I do not know actually we wrote a song about it, listen to the words, it’ll it’ll kind of inspire you to feel the plight of these people.

mayonnaise taco Monday, I put it on the dog
mayonnaise taco Monday, hey
mayonnaise taco Monday, I put it on the dog
mayonnaise taco Monday,

mayonnaise taco Monday, you put it in your sleeve
mayonnaise taco Monday, it makes me want to, makes me want to
makes me want to heave!

those poor people

did you sense the empathy in that song
the bleeding-heartedness of that overture

it touched something

you

you know and

woo

all right we

we apologize, Five Iron Frenzy, in general, Five Iron Frenzy apologizes, just blanket apology, for all of the eight years of that

while we are on the subject of amnesty and uh being being you know like being doing nice things for other, uh, something we would like to do for you is, I know when you go the rock shows a lot of times you are, you go, and then the band plays all the songs, and then, they play the second to best song and then they leave, and then they go high line the amplifiers, and you are like “yeah, come back smash mouth” and then you cheer for them, and then, you they come back out and then they play their best song

yeah

well

I feel that, that is somewhat deceitful so right now we are just gonna get this out of the way, we are gonna play the absolute best song we have ever written, and uh then if you guys want to go home then you can, uh, so there won’t be any of that clapping stuff at the end. um

one more song

this song is the best song we have ever written, it’s very important that you listen to the word

yeah pootermobile

pootermobile

pootermobile

pootermobile

thanks I forgot I forgot how that one goes

all right so now you guys can go home if you want

we’ll play some more songs though
