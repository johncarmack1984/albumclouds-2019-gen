like nothing you have ever seen, it’s “titanic” as a simile. we are double-fisting caffeine, while our bones are cracking dismally. did you hear what’s coming back? boomerangs. now raise the mast. raise your glass, here’s one for ice packs. let’s pour some out for those who have passed. set your cadence to a different drum. set your sights on the horizon.

we can start a fire, we can light it up and keep it burning. we can start a fire, boomerangs come back, they just keep returning.

no time left to eulogize, yesterday can take care of yesterday. let’s raise our sails to the skies, diving headfirst back into the fray. set your cadence to a different drum. set your sights on the horizon.

we can start a fire, we can light it up and keep it burning. we can start a fire, boomerangs come back, they just keep returning.

there you are, hogging the front page. drawing blanks when thinking of sin’s wage. if everyone has fallen short some humbleness is overdue. if I wished your face got stabbed, well, I’d be just as bent as you.

there’s a chip that’s on my shoulder, sucking us into quicksand. the temperature is getting colder a backwards ticking second hand.

there you go bullying again, stealing the spotlight from better men. if God is love, you got it wrong, waving all your placards and flags. the very fact that you are alive, says God must also love douche bags.

there’s a chip that’s on my shoulder, sucking us into quicksand. the temperature is getting colder a backwards ticking second hand.

there’s a chip that’s on my shoulder, sucking us into quicksand. the temperature is getting colder a backwards ticking second hand.

and the only saving grace, we only ever need speak of, if ever there’s a question, the answer is to love.

the answer is to love.

there’s a chip that’s on my shoulder, sucking us into quicksand. the temperature is getting colder a backwards ticking second hand.

there’s a chip that’s on my shoulder, sucking us into quicksand. the temperature is getting colder a backwards ticking second hand.back when the angels of heaven would sing
days when I still made you feel something
and before what might be
became what's already been
blizzards and bygones
the frost and no thaw
airways constricting
and vessels withdraw

and you look around but find yourself all alone
and you hunker down but the cold's
already in your bones
ooh ooh ooh ooh

I lit a fire
it started then stopped
elements will conspire
and mercury drop
and you look around but find yourself all alone
and you hunker down but the cold’s already in your bones

ooh
there's a flicker of desire
ooh
and a memory of youth
ooh
a faintly
glowing fire 
ooh
for some truth

can you stand the weather (ooh)
if winter lasts forever? (ooh)
can you stand the weather (ooh)

there goes my basement down the embankment there goes my Ernie doll over the waterfall in my favorite chair, but I don’t care, and I don’t need it.

freedom flies like drops of rain. this love is like a hurricane. just close your eyes, and keep holding on- as we ride into the storm.

there goes my backup plan. there goes my minivan. there goes my fear and insecurity. there goes my pride over the side. ‘cause I don’t need it.

freedom flies like drops of rain. this love is like a hurricane. just close your eyes, and keep holding on- as we ride into the storm.

into the storm

freedom flies like drops of rain. this love is like a hurricane. just close your eyes, and keep holding on- as we ride into the storm.

freedom flies like drops of rain. this love is like a hurricane. just close your eyes, and keep holding on- as we ride into the storm.
well alas the final wave
settled many in their grave
yet here I am just standing like a tree

I have a map and I have a spade
and there’s a treasure in a cave
somewhere on the coast just west of Tripoli

Jude and Finley are my pride
I leave Molly by my side
the inferno she’s the jewel of the very fleet
push and pull that anchor’s ‘weigh
for the seven seas we sway
to a distant shore
where the air is cool and sweet

to Astoria!
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
to Astoria!
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

well I have a crew and I have a plan
and once we have the loot in hand
we’ll point our bow toward Astoria town

through the hills of foam and green
Jude and Fin, Molly and me
we’ll have it all before the sun goes down

Jude and Finley are my pride
I leave Molly by my side
the inferno she’s the jewel of the very fleet
push and pull that anchor’s ‘weigh
for the seven seas we sway
to a distant shore
where the air is cool and sweet

“are we losing you now, November-one-two?”,
said the radio, hoping to break through.
“we can get you out, if you’ll just keep on.”
and the plot keeps thickening, so please be strong.
and all this time, you have never given up and you are never giving out.
and all this time, you can never go back, but you have never had more doubt.

between the pavement and the stars,
beneath the the weight of years of scars,

signal’s breaking up, at the edge of night.
have you lost the will to be in this fight?
just keep digging in, don’t give up on us yet.
are we coming in clear, on the radio set?
and all this time, when there’s hardly any day, and hardly ever night
all this time, where you are halfway in shadows, and halfway in light.

between the pavement and the stars,
beneath the the weight of years of scars,
burns the same soul-
paint the sky blue.
hallelujah,
you are still you.

and Love is patient,
it barely crawls.
and Love has only
conquered all.

and Love is patient,
it barely crawls.
and Love has only
conquered all.

and Love is patient,
it barely crawls.
and Love has only
conquered all.

and Love is patient,
it barely crawls.
and Love has only
conquered all.

between the pavement and the stars,
beneath the the weight of years of scars,
burns the same soul-
paint the sky blue.
Hallelujah,
you are still you.

burns the same soul-
paint the sky blue.
Hallelujah,
you are still you.
