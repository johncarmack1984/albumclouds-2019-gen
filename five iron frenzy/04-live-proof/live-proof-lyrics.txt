okay Cornerstone 1999 please welcome Five Iron Frenzy

Cornerstone are you ready

there is one thing I have to say before we play this song
that is: "to hell with the devil!”WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

here lies the old myth
breaking the mold with
truth to take away the trickery
twenty centuries of progress
suffer slowly as we regress
losing headway to ourselves
behold the covers, the sisters, the mothers
the daughters, and spouses, on the magazines
truth has been abused
how could she fill those shoes?
propaganda meant to fuel their schemes

she is strong but never silent
sure of where her strength comes from
one day, one girl army will overcome

treading the current, issues at hand
shifting, we sway, from justice and then back again
what we once broke, He has made right
lifting her up, giving birth to Jesus Christ

she is strong but never silent
sure of where her strength comes from
one day, one girl army will overcome

everyone throw your hands in the air
it is okay

she is strong but never silent
sure of where her strength comes from
one day, one girl army will overcome

she is strong but never silent
sure of where her strength comes from
one day, one girl army will overcome

what is up, Cornerstone?
thank you for rocking!

this is a rock and roll songhah hookchaptha

welcome to Canada, it is the maple leaf state
Canada, oh, Canada, it is great
the people are nice there, they speak French too
if you do not like it, man, you sniff glue
the great white north, their kilts are plaid
hosers take off, it is not that bad

I want to be where yaks can run free
where the Royal Mounties can arrest me

let us go to Canada
let us leave today
Canada, oh Canada
I s'il vous plait

they have got trees and mooses and sled dogs
lots of lumber and lumberjacks... and logs!
do you think that is kind of a drag
that you have to go there to get milk in a bag
they say "eh" instead of "what" or "duh"
that is the mighty power of Canada

I want to be where lemmings run into the sea
where the marmosets can attack me

let us go to Canada
let us leave today
Canada, oh Canada
I s'il vous plait

let us go to Canada
let us leave today
Canada, oh Canada
I s'il vous plait

please, please explain to me
how this all has come to be
we forgot to mention something here
did we say that William Shatner, Captain Kirk is a citizen
and slurpees made from venison
that is deer!

let us go to Canada
let us leave today
Canada, oh Canada
I s'il vous plait

let us go to Canada
let us leave today
Canada, oh Canada
I s'il vous plaitha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha

beautiful day, wonderful feeling
I feel like singing
Psalms - meaning songs - singing praises all day long
joy fills the weak; joy makes us strong
filled 'till we burst, songs of praise to the God of the Universe

despite our selfish selves
despite all loss of hope
despite our lack of faith
despite our stony hearts
despite the waning moon
despite the ebbing tide of how we think this world should be

praise God from whom all blessings flow
praise Him all creatures here below
praise Him above, ye heavenly host
praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost

gray rainy day down in the mud for us
do not feel I can sing
songs to the God in control of the Seasons
what is good and bad
flow from thy hands
of the God with the perfect plan
filled with joy all of this will glorify

despite our selfish selves
despite all loss of hope
despite our lack of faith
despite our stony hearts
despite the waning moon
despite the ebbing tide of how we think this world should be

praise God from whom all blessings flow
praise Him all creatures here below
praise Him above, ye heavenly host
praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost

various animal noises:
sounds of a cat; sounds of a donkey; various sounds of wild, pygmy elephants; a hippy. meow

ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha
ha ha ha ha

two three go
praise God from whom all blessings flow
praise Him all creatures here below
praise Him above ye heavenly host
praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost

what is up, rockers?
basically there is only one thing we have come to say to you today and that is "to hell with the devil!" Rahr!
once again my friends that is "to hell with the devil!" Yeah, rahr!
devil!
devil!
devil!
thank you
uh, here is a heavy metal songyeah!

you found a way to draw a line between the world and you faking your identity it is true
did you think the word "alternative" was only meant for the likes of you?
do you think that they are too cool now?
being popular is lame
you are the one who made them popular
all their songs are still the same

you found them first, it made you stand apart, you know?
but then everyone jumped on the same bandwagon
making you an average Joe
a lemming for the mediocre
you were just a plain old joker, status quo
blame it on the band now
if you prick them do they bleed?
what is the point in playing what they want, if you will not let them succeed?

do you remember where we all came from?
do you remember what it is all about?
when you made a point to be objective
before you started writing the Handbook for the Sellout?

yeah, yeah!

you sunk your worth in being different
just to be like your own kind
you traded in objectiveness
for the underground you follow blind

do you remember where we all came from?
do you remember what it is all about?
when you made a point to be objective
before you started writing the Handbook for the Sellout?

I am gonna, I wanna, hey I am
I wanna sing a song
can I sing a song?
Sonnie, Sonnie, Sonnie, are you gonna play?
you gonna play this song? I am gonna sing
okay, this song - I am only gonna sing this song if, uh, our horn players agree to sing background vocals
are you guys gonna do it?

Oh yeah

this song is dedicated to my mom 'cause she is here tonight
yeah
and this song is by a heavy metal band called Vengeance Rising and the name of this song is called "Receive Him"
I hope you like it; here we goreceive him!

thanks. that goes out to my mom: she is proud of me because of the way I dress
alright
thank you! you! I said "thank you."
this song is called “I am so hot (I am gonna have a heat stroke)"where does the misunderstanding come from?
demanding that we be outstanding and then some?
perfection never was a requirement although some might say we desired it
so then for times when things get old I might get cynical
I see that I do not see
do they see You when they see me?

in honesty there is room for improvement
thoughts may change , the truth be told
a closed mind will leave you empty
use your mind to use your soul

alert the press, their dogmas are a mess
opinions shift, a broken sift, an empty hand
and billboards ask, "where do they stand?"
do all streams lead to one sea?

logically there is room for all questions
though the answers are not all known
objectivity is the myth of plenty
who doubt His truth within their soul

in honesty there is room for improvement
thoughts may change , the truth be told
a closed mind will leave you empty
use your mind to use your soul

I am sorry about that spittle that just flew out of my mouth
I, I gotta apologize for that
this is a praise song; I hope you like it
it is called "dandelions"in a field of yellow flowers underneath the sun
bluest eyes that spark with lightning; boy with shoes undone
he is young, so full of hope reveling in tiny dreams
filling up his arms with flowers right for giving any queen

running to her, beaming bright while cradling his prize
a flickering of yellow light within his mother's eyes
she holds them to her heart keeping them where they will be safe
clasped within her very marrow, dandelions in a vase

she sees love where anyone else would see weeds
all hope is found, here is everything he needs

fathomless Your endless mercy weight I could not lift
where do I fit in this puzzle? What good are these gifts?
not a martyr or a saint
scarcely can I struggle through
all that I have ever wanted was to give my best to You

Lord search my heart create in me something clean
dandelions: You see flowers in these weeds

gently lifting hands to heaven
softened by the sweetest hush
a Father sings over His children
loving them so very much
more than words could warrant
deeper than the darkest blue
all that I have ever wanted
was to give my heart to You

Lord search my heart create in me something clean
dandelions: You see flowers in these weeds

Lord search my heart create in me something clean
dandelions: You see flowers in these weedsCoke bottle glasses
I am sitting in the corner with my finger up my nose
and my shoelaces untied again
another day of school with no friends (whoa-oh, whoa-oh)
a social outcast
two grades ahead in math
with my highwater pants
giving meaning to pencil-necked-geek
a dork or so to speak, tongue-in-cheek

they are all sucker-punching me
get in line for a wedgie
all I want and all I need
is someone who believes in me

a song sung for underdogs
for all the left out
a flag flying for losers
somewhere in the heavens
the God of ever-lasting comfort
He believed in me
loved me when I was faithless
He still died for me

junior high schooler
with pencils in my pockets
and my Trapper Keeper busted
spilling papers and books on the floor
not wanting seventh grade anymore (whoa-oh, whoa-oh)
another class-clown
acting like a goof to be accepted by my peers
giving meaning to pencil-necked-geek
a dork or so to speak, tongue in cheek

they are all sucker-punching me
get in line for a wedgie
all I want and all I need
as someone who believes in me

a song sung for underdogs
for all the left out
a flag flying for losers
somewhere in the heavens
the God of ever-lasting comfort
he Believed in me
loved me when I was faithless
He still died for me

a song sung for underdogs
for all the left out
a flag flying for losers
somewhere in the heavens
the God of ever-lasting comfort
believed in me
loved me when I was faithless
He still died for me

wow I, I coughed up a hairball

hey, hey Reese

yeah, Dennis. what is up, dude?

well I I am kind of embarrassed and I know this is a weird place to ask you this but, I am like, I am not doing very good with the girls buddy, and I am, I am losing hope. what can I do?

oh man. well, Dennis, like, I do not know that much about girls but I will tell you what little I know and that is: well you see, my friend, it is not unusual to be loved by anyone
no, my friends, it is not unusual to have fun with anyone
or something like thatit is not unusual to be loved by anyone
it is not unusual to have fun with anyone
when I see you hanging out with anyone
it is not unusual to see me cry
I wanna die

it is not unusual to go out for anytime
but when I see you hanging about, it is such a crime
if you should ever want to be loved by anyone
it is not unusual, it happens everyday
no matter what you say
you will find it happens all the time
love will never do
what you want it to
why can not this crazy love be mine?

it is not unusual to be mad with anyone
it is not unusual to be sad with anyone
if you should ever feel like changing your mind
it is not unusual to find that I am in love with you

whoa ho whoa whoa
yeah ha yeah yeah
no no no no
yeah ha yeah yeah
yeah yeah yeah yeah
no!

I hope you still like us
okay, this one is called Anthem
I hope you hate ita nation stands with heart in hand
to sing their anthem proudly
voices raised to sing their praise
of their hollow country
all this talk of freedom
and this talk of liberty
from your plastic podium
you try and convince me

I can not fall anymore (do do do do)
for some silver-tongued song
freedom is not free (do do do do)
so let me say what freedom means to -


I can not see red, white, and blue waving in the air
I do not hear the bombs bursting and I do not even care
sorry for my lack of faith
I am not the greatest patriot
if this is all there is to freedom I do not want it

I can not fall anymore (do do do do)
for some silver-tongued song
freedom is not free (do do do do)
so let me say what freedom means to

pushing us a drug that you call freedom and democracy
promise us that selfishness is the means for happiness
I burned that bridge so long ago that I can hardly see
anything but solace in what freedom means to me

say this with me:
who holds your freedom? who holds your liberty?
who holds your freedom? who holds your liberty?

who holds your freedom? who holds your liberty?
who holds your freedom? who holds your liberty?
who holds your freedom? who holds your liberty?
who holds your freedom? Jesus Christ!

I can not fall anymore
for some silver-tongued song
freedom is not free
so let me say what freedom means to -

it cannot mean to serve ourselves
that does not mean a thing
it does not mean to give the license
to seek ourselves in anything
that would be a slavery to ourselves; it is not free
Jesus Christ, the only thing that freedom means to me

Jesus Christ is freedom

this is uh, this is gonna be a new song
um, it is called a new hope and it is also about freedom
but this freedom, um, we live in Denver, Colorado and uh, you guys all know what went down at Columbine
well, we practice at Micah's house, which is, like, three or four blocks from there and his sister went to school there - she was, like one of the kids locked in the choir room
and uh, when we are at home everyone is talking about it but the thing is that they try, they try and blame that on, on video games and try and blame it on bad parenting and try and blame it on TV violence and stuff
I think all those things are bad, but I think the real problem is that mankind is dark and that without God people do things like that
and uh, so, it is called a new hopeAmy is going back to school today
elation, jubilation streams from her face
did the halls smell of gunpowder still?
what made the human mind dark enough to kill?

a new hope
where is your freedom?
a new hope
cast off your burdens

a darker world lies behind this one
cryptic, it hides beneath perception
we all saw it on that day
stunned, we stood stuttering
what did the news say?

a new hope
where is your freedom?
a new hope
cast off your burdens
a new hope
where is your freedom?
a new hope
here is your freedom

peace floods us
by hope we steer
our dark hearts salvaged
we live without fear

peace floods us
by hope we steer
our dark hearts salvaged
we live without fear

peace floods us
by hope we steer
our dark hearts salvaged
we live without fear

a new hope
here is your freedom
a new hope
cast off your burdens
a new hope
here is your freedom?
a new hope
here is your freedom
hope

this song has been around since the beginning of time
it is very old
it is about an amusement park ride

have amusement parks been around since the beginning of time?

uh, well the theme of this amusement park has been around, uh, a kinda long time

a long time, but not since the beginning of time

okay, not really

does time really have a beginning and ending?

I do not know

hmmmm

just play the song

um, feel free to march around in unison during this song

kingdom of the kinosaurs
kingdom of the dinosaurs
rip off your face of the dinosaurs
kingdom of the dinosaursstraight from the ghetto streets of Harlem
come two brothers Willis and Arnold
black goldfish swims in the bowl
he is three feet high; four with the afro
stealing cookies from the jar
dropping water balloons on cars
I hope Mrs. Garret will not see
just play sick for Mohammed Ali
the Gooch is coming to steal milk money

Arnold and Willis and Mr. Drumond
and do not forget Kimberly
they just cancelled Dukes of Hazard
Different Strokes is all I want to see

way up high in the penthouse apartment
making us laugh its Willis and Arnold
Mr. Drumond has got the dough
they get to ride in a limo
Different Strokes, its almost time
we just watch because Kimberly is fine
half hour long it never fills us
when he says, "What you talkin' 'bout Willis?"
write the cable company
Different Strokes all the time

Arnold and Willis and Mr. Drumond
and do not forget Kimberly
they just cancelled Dukes of Hazard
Different Strokes is all I want to see

Mr. Drumond, a man of the means
loves two black brothers, they have only got the blue jeans

Mr. Drumond, a man of the means
loves two black brothers, they have only got the blue jeans
go!

this is a new songI do not know just how this happened
I did not think it ever could
I am the author of sappy love songs
trading in my bachelorhood
something snapped deep inside me
something that somebody said
I felt the brush of angel's wings then
your voice echo in my head

ugly day, sun is shining
every cloud has got a silver lining
ugly day, skies are blue
now every day is ugly without you

you are the one pure thing
that I have always prayed for
scales are falling from my eyes
I must have been so blind before
I would lie down on the street
to keep the dust off of your feet
I would kneel each time I kissed you
anything, Christie I miss you

ugly day, sun is shining
every cloud has got a silver lining
ugly day, skies are blue
now every day is ugly without you

whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

today was an ugly one
just like all the others
all the flowers and the birds
making me feel smothered
I would lie down on the street
to keep the dust up off of your feet
I would kneel each time I kissed you
anything, Christie I miss you

ugly day, sun is shining
every cloud has got a silver lining
ugly day, skies are blue
now every day is ugly without
ugly day, sun is shining
every cloud has got a silver lining
ugly day, skies are blue
now every day is ugly without you

whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
good ska!

I wanna do one more song. is that okay?
okay. this is just one more quick song I want to do real quick and it is dedicated to all the people that are over here, 'cause you guys have been real supportive and cool

when I go out I play in the street
get hit by cars
get hit by cars
play in the street!
ow!

thank you

yay

for those of you listening at home we are trying to figure out what Chaka is going to hit next. And uh, yeah, it is pretty hard to tell, so, it is pretty unpredictable

come on, Chaka!

yeah yeah! Ow!

anyway, uh, this song is about our lovely city of - our lovely hometown - of Denver, Coloradocar broke down in Arizona
have to ride the bus again
ten o’clock on Tuesday night
with thirteen cents and a broken pen
I put my backpack on the bench
tell two people I do not smoke
see the cop across the street
he thinks that I am selling dope

I could have walked another block
to get away from the scene
why does it always come to this
where zero meets fifteen?

and so I gave my thirteen cents
to the man who peed his pants
he passes out and falls on me
I watch my change fall from his hand
I see the lady next to me
holds her baby black blue
the junkie gutter-punks keeps asking
where I got my new tattoo

what does it matter anyway
thirteen cents or all I own?
how can I ever save the world
on Cup-o-Soup and student loans?

and I want to try and save the world
but it never goes that way
God, I do not know what to do
down at Colfax and Broadway

now the man with no shoes on
says I do not know how to play
he says I fumble all the time
he thinks that I am John Elway
put my face down in my hands
water wells inside my eyes
what do I have to give them?
does it matter if I try?

I can not stand to see you suffer
I try to intellectualize
a formula to end your pain
it does not work
God knows I have tried

I want to try and save the world
but it never goes that way
God, I do not know what to do
down at Colfax and Broadway

sometimes my cup is overfilled
sometimes I am too afraid that I am going to spill

I want to try and save the world
but it never goes that way
God, I do not know what to do
down at Colfax and Broadway

hi Keith

hey Reese. 
what is up?

how are you doing, buddy?

I am good. how are you guys doing? cool
thanks you guys for coming and staying up late with us

hey, Keith, um, what are you doing over there?  uh, over here?  yeah, over there  I am keeping it real. what are you guys doing out there? are you keeping it real?  word  keep it real  how about under there?  what? hey yeah! Keith, what were you eating under there?  under where?  oh my gosh, you were eating...  oh, wait, we gotta take that off the albums  I do not get it  so it will make it in the, in the Christian bookstores

it helps to eat a tasty low-fat snack before you exercise

it is time to burn up those carbos
come on, two, yeah!

bacon bits and jalapeños on my polish hot dog
half a pound of potato chips, and a beef jerky log
press my face to the window
wrapper sticks to my shirt
eight people in a stinky van
couple more could not hurt

eat some food off the floor
I have developed a taste for bread mold
ride around in a van
do not take a shower for six weeks and

we have been given superpowers
ask us for an autograph
we sing, we dance, we will make you laugh
do not you want to be like us?

no

everyone in the band can not stand me
just because I ate pork and beans
and kind of by accident
I farted?
sometimes we have a deadline, for learning these words
five minutes left to learn this song
la, la, la, la, la, la, la la

sleep in a sleeping bag
every floor looks the same as last night
you wake up
you drive
you play a show
and then you sleep again


we have been given superpowers
ask us for an autograph
we sing, we dance, we will make you laugh
do not you want to be like us?

we have been given super powers
ask about our rock and roll
our hair, our clothes, hobbies, and pets
does she have a boyfriend yet?

I sometimes feel like I am Holden Caufield
sometimes Jack Kerouac
I wanted to be famous, now I want to take it back

do not want to rock the mic
do not want to meet the Pope
I just want to share with you
how we got this peace and hope

yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

we have been given superpowers (I once wanted to be famous)
ask us for an autograph (Now I want to take it back)
we have been given superpowers (I once wanted to be famous)
ask us for an autograph (Now I want to take it back)

right now we are just going to bring it down a couple notches
take it down for all of youyou know, guys, I know what it is like to be at the rock and roll concerts. you go, you might be a little bit lonely, you might look to your right or left and maybe you see this - I just drooled on myself - a beautiful young lady. and you are saying to yourself: "if only they would play a slow song so that I might take that young lady in my arms and slow dance with her as if the night would never end."

well my friends, now is your chance! take that girl in your arms and slow dance like there is no tomorrow! this is all fake!

summer of 1978
my sister and I in the back seat just wait
we pass the time by making lines on the seat that we can not cross
a thin line like dental floss

she threw my new blue comb out the window, somewhere on I-70
dad said, “I am sorry, but we can not go back,"
we are never going back to get it
it was the first comb I ever had
got it just that morning from my mom and my dad
light blue in color, I could never have another
comb like that, big and fat

so tell me, have you seen my comb?
last time I saw it, it was in her hands
and then it was bouncing down the road
it was not fancy, it was not brown
but now it might be from lying on the ground
so tell me, have you seen my comb?

driving down the road in September
I was only five but I still remember
where the highway turns at the bottom of the hill
my parents both up front 'cause they loved each other still
an ordinary comb made of plastic
or an action of a sibling lacking couth
it was not just a comb that was thrown out that window
was the last great symbol of my youth

have you seen my comb?
last time I saw it, it was in her hands
and then it was bouncing down the road
it was not fancy, it was not brown
but now it might be from lying on the ground
so tell me, have you seen my comb?

thanks a lot you guys. thank you for coming out. we have had a lot of fun tonight. seriously, thank you guys for coming out

this is our last song and it is a, it is a prayer. I say this, like, every night but I mean it. um, this is something that I have to, I have to pray myself every day. cause, uh, I do not know, I just think that this, the purpose of this world is, like, is not to, not so you get all the, all the cool houses and toys and cars and stuff that you want. it is pretty much just to make you realize how, how much of a jerk you are and how much you need God. and, uh, this song is about how when you are at the bottom and you realize that you are the biggest jerk in the world, you need God to carry you and he loves you enough to look past how big a jerk you are and carry you. it is called "every new day."when I was young, the smallest trick of light
could catch my eye
then life was new and every new day
I thought that I could fly
I believed in what I hoped for
and I hoped for things unseen
I had wings and dreams could soar
I just do not feel like flying anymore

when the stars threw down their spears
watered Heaven with their tears
before words were spoken
before eternity

dear Father, I need you
your strength my heart to mend
I want to fly higher
every new day again

when I was small, the furthest I could reach
was not so high
then I thought the world was so much smaller
feeling that I could fly
through distant deeps and skies
behind infinity
below the face of Heaven
he stoops to create me

dear Father, I need you
Your strength my heart to mend
I want to fly higher
every new day again

you are not alone
you are not alone
you are not alone
you are never alone
man versus himself
man versus machine
man versus the world
mankind versus me
the struggles go on
the wisdom I lack
the burdens keep piling
up on my back
so hard to breathe
to take the next step
the mountain is high
I wait in the depths
yearning for grace
and hoping for peace
dear God
increase

healing hands of God have mercy on our unclean souls once again
Jesus Christ, light of the world burning bright within our hearts forever
freedom means love without condition, without a beginning or an end
here is my heart, let it be forever yours
only You can make every new day seem so new

I love you Lord and I lift my voice
to worship you oh my soul rejoice
take joy my King in what You hear
may it be a sweet sweet sound in Your ear

ah heh heh heh heh

Dennis is trying to ask me a question 

oh Dennis is asking a question

is your name Dennis

the moment is gone I

come on Dennis

I was ready to open up okay

did I wreck it?

I did not wreck it did I?

yes Keith, you wrecked it with your stupid movie reference

sorry

it is not funny okay

hey how many of you guys were here last year when we played

okay okay

we played here two years ago

oh it was two years ago okay

um look we are sellouts now and you have to sit in seats 

and we are not playing the punk rock stage and I want to apologize to all the punk rockers, we are sorry we are sellouts, we hope you still like us

speaking of sellouts, this song is called Dandelions

everyone in the band can not stand me

just because I am a hip hopper 

and kinda by accident 

I am also uh dumb

sometimes we have a deadline

for writing these words

social outcast oolele olooo heh blah 
and I am forgetting the words again because I did not learn them today

everyone in the band can not stand me
just because I have nasty shorts
and kinda by accident 
um there is too much leg being shown

ooh Metallica yeah I know

I just have one more thing to say 

ha ha ha ha ha
