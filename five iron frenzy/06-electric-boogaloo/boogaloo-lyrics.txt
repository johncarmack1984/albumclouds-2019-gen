my sluggish heart is beating seven beats too slow
another sad song and another shot of blue

cold and unconcerned are anything but new
He said "Love endures all things"

and it hurts to think He is right;
if I mark the span of failure
is His burden just as light?

I am
Spartan

close my heart so tight
Jesus
save me
from myself tonight

limping through the world
there is a knowing look or two
is it just the cripples here
who understand the truth?
why is love so painful?
why do we always lose?
paving pathways for the lost
the bitter, and recluse?
he said "Love endures all things"
and it hurts to think it is true
did it nail Him to a cross?
did it crucify Him too?

I am, Spartan
close my heart so tight
Jesus
save me
from myself tonight

the angels are singing over the plains
the shepherds are quaking, echoing refrains
and all of our slogans designed to take away the pain
meant nothing to the Son of God that night in Bethlehem

I am, Spartan
close my heart so tight
Jesus
save me
from myself tonightinto mass graves we have shoveled lives
a massive pipeline for the lies
a past so vast with genocide
and ignorance we hide behind
you say that we are done with this
turn blind eyes and still dismiss
chalk this up as something passed
and still create a lower caste


lies lies lies lies
the way you live shows no remorse
for the day/ the day we killed Crazy Horse
innocence with glassy eyes
kill the nation, steal their pride

on broken backs we build empires
twisting spines for the steeple spires
how many people can you kill?
look at your twenty dollar bill
do you see third world poverty
inside the lines of your country?
and now to treaties we are loyal
but tear them up when we smell oil

lies lies lies lies
the way you live shows no remorse
for the day/ the day we killed Crazy Horse
innocence with glassy eyes
kill the nation, steal their pride

I can still see the butchered women and children lying heaped and scattered all along the crooked gulch
and I can see that something else died there in the bloody mud, and was buried in the blizzard. a people's dream died there. it was a beautiful dream

the way you live shows no remorse
for the day
the day we killed Crazy Horse
innocence with glassy eyes
kill the nation, steal their pride

the way you live shows no remorse
for the day/ the day we killed Crazy Horse
innocence with glassy eyes
kill the nation, steal their pride

one thing but your actions tell the truth on you

so, blue mix means to weaken sound
turns concert halls to battlegrounds
make us pay to go on tour
marked up t-shirts to match yours
blind fans, gold mine
you are, dollar signs
and when did this become a contest?
I guess we lost it long ago

blue mixes

see the brilliant gleam of the automatic tooth flosser
beautiful new china, what a lovely cup and saucer
yeah I saw your Rolex, but I think it is an impostor
wave to the pretty ladies
with your brand new hairpiece, baby
ahh, the smell of cash, it is good to be alive
I am going to spend some dough like it is 1985

rip the tags off mattresses
you will buy more anyway

is the paint on that SUV

some brand new type of gray?

they say the word on the street

so tight your best friend
left him to fly
and never could reach him
standing at the peak where two waves meet
are you just behind the other side of music?
peering like a flower never taught to grow
someone fond of living always will remember

we are blessed, we endure

our eyes always looked
dark and the same
what does he see
who returns his smile?
and when Car's a sword its wit that stings
now he will be used in our Father's army
not as one who kills but one who always heals
can I take his burden, who am I to follow?

we are blessed, we endure
we are blessed, we endure

one who travels knows too well
the panicked call from the truck stop
I held tight to the phone booth
envisioning last night and Car's last mountain drive

we are blessed, we endure
I am blessed, I will enduretoday
all the sources would agree
that the day of their death was a cold dark day
scuttled
ships have blocked the sea
and the pallid light of morning melts into an ashy gray

and goodbye to everything
sayonara everyone
they are tired
write the eulogy

no one
understood a word they said
hailed them all as kings up upon a pedestal
their names
scribbled on a parchment piece
would sink like any ship listing fast from ruptured hull

and goodbye to everything
sayonara everyone
they are tired
write the eulogy
and I saw them as they passed
it was like a millstone cast
far into the deep blue sea

the murky sea is black
dismal and so deep
millstones rocket through the dark
into its icy keep
a resting place for broken ships
a cemetery for the humble
no one is here to make you stumble

if Jesus Christ is true
then I am mostly lies
if Jesus Christ is Love
then I have failed to try
if Jesus Christ is Life
then please just let me die
let
this
die
