wind passes right through my skin as I fall down, this furious speed will only destroy me
crippling and devastating momentum, approaching maximum velocity
and this is how it's going to be, the point of it all, 'cause this is what was meant for me, recklessly I fall

hulking, smashing, I come crashing, nothing like when I was small
I am unstoppable, I am the cannonball

thirty-two feet per second I increase, as the exponents will multiply
I'll never stop to look back behind me, cutting through the bright blue sky
and this is how it's meant to be, untethered I will soar
I'll barrel towards the earth below, it's what I was made for


hulking, smashing, I come crashing, nothing like when I was small
I am unstoppable, I am the cannonball
that feeble coward that you knew, has undergone an overhaul
I am unstoppable, I am the cannonball

and everyone will say it's just an accident, like some mishap or a tragedy
I think that failure has a purpose, and I don't believe its chance if I fall
and I know that if I ever do fall, he will catch me
and if he ever lets me fall down, for the good of those who believe him
he will make me into a cannonball
cannonball
cannonball
cannonball

unblemished, and faultless. a burning luminescence (cannonball)
unequaled precision, beyond your scope of vision (cannonball)

I'm twenty-nine years old
still wearing the wallet chain
like I was twenty-eight
I'm wearing my vans right now
so high school kids
will think that I can skate
I've got a degree in science
yet shaking my fists in defiance

anyway, I'm not cliche
I hardly own any ties
I may be old
but at least I'm not like all those other old guys

I'm watching MTV for fashion tips
so I can say that I saw it first
backwards hat, tattoos, and goatee;
say I'm cool
just like Fred Durst
I pay almost all my bills
I sleep on a futon still

anyway, I'm not cliche
I hardly own any ties
I may be old
but at least I'm not like all those other old guys

I may be old
but at least I'm not like all those other old guyswe thought we'd write a song about all the problems inherent in the industry
it was going to be an expose written in unblemished symmetry
we were going to have our glorious exit, an admonition and an encore
we were going to make a point to the whole world
but no one wants to hear it anymore

don't worry what this song would say, you'll never hear it anyway
they won't play this song on the radio
so far, so bad, that's how it goes
they'll pull our records from the shelves
so far, so bad, that's how it goes

the rhyme scheme to this song was mostly flawless
it might have made good poetry
it could have bridged the gap between the classes
and overthrown the bourgeoisie 
it made a couple points about the future
and how the past was kind of uncool
and if you ever tried to play it backwards
it told the kids to stay in school

don't worry what this song would say, you'll never hear it anyway
they won't play this song on the radio
so far, so bad, that's how it goes
they'll pull our records from the shelves
so far, so bad, that's how it goes

I thought i'd write an epiphany, how something good is changing me
but i guess we dodged some passing fad
it looks like its so far, so bad. 
so bad
this song is rad. 
uh you could ask your dad. 
he won't be mad. this song is stupid!

they won't play this song on the radio
so far, so bad, that's how it goes
they'll pull our records from the shelves
so far, so bad, that's how it goesit's new year's eve and I'm full of empty promises
I half pretend to keep this time
just like last year

the band is loud and I'm wandering the shadows
wishing I was never here
I persevere

a crowded room
these whitewashed tombs
they raise their glasses high
they kiss the past goodbye

this new year's eve, I'm waiting for tomorrow
my heart is on my sleeve, and yes I still believe
this new year's eve, will turn out better than before
I'm holding on, still holding out
until they close the door... on me

it's new year's eve and I feel my insecurities
are haunting me like ghosts, this sinking quicksand
and then with thunderous praise and lofty adoration
a second passes by, yet nothing changes

I hate my skin
this grave I'm standing in
another change of years
and I wish I wasn't here

this new year's eve, I'm waiting for tomorrow
my heart is on my sleeve, and yes I still believe
this new year's eve, will turn out better than before
I'm holding on, still holding out
until they close the door... on me

a year goes by and I'm staring at my watch again
and I dig deep this time
tor something greater than I've ever been
fife to ancient wineskins. And I was blind but now I see

this new year's eve, something must change me inside
I'm crooked and misguided, and tired of being tired

this new year's eve, I'm waiting for tomorrow
my heart is on my sleeve, and yes I still believe, in You

yeah 

in YouAmerican kryptonite

yeah

he is the icon of our times, solution to our modern crimes
his trigger finger clicks remotes, as carbohydrates slowly bloat

not fragile, or brittle. he's seeking an acquittal
no scruples, no meekness, he has but one great weakness

all the world must have a price
save yourself from sacrifice
everything will end alright
American kryptonite

his might hands will hardly fail, his intellect is barely frail
he moves his lips in perfect sync, demanding an espresso drink
with passion, he searches, he'll make another purchase
familiar you know him, he's saying that you owe him

all the world must have a price
save yourself from sacrifice
everything will end alright
American kryptonite

it was like the manifest destiny all over again, except
instead of taking and consuming everything in their paths for God
they did so with the same fervor
and sense of entitlement for their new god...themselves

buy, take, break, throw it away
buy, take, break, throw it away
buy, take, break, throw it away
buy, take, break, throw it away

buy, take, break, throw it away

throw it away
throw it away
throw it away
throw it away

all the world must have a price
save yourself from sacrifice
everything will end alright
American kryptonitewe flew over Alaska;
we saw the frozen mountains pierce the clouds
it was beautiful
we felt the waves of new Zealand;
the water shimmered beneath a moonlight shroud
it was beautiful

close to home in an ordinary room
we felt You there
it's my favorite memory
You're so beautiful

the spring in Appalachia
with flowers swaying above the fields of green
it was beautiful
driving in new England
the road littered with bright October leaves
it was beautiful

close to home in an ordinary room
we felt You there
it's my favorite memory
You're so beautiful to me
thanks for the songs
these seven friends and eight good years
it is You that made them sweet
it was beautiful

pictures looking back
just snapshots of the past cannot compare
to feeling what we felt
through anything that came
that You were there

a thousand smiling faces
backlit and bouncing to the beat
it was beautiful
as many soaring voices
forever changed by Your mercy
it was beautiful

far away from all the lights and noise
we felt You there
it's my favorite memory
You're so beautiful to me

thanks for the songs
these seven friends
and eight good years
it is You that made them sweet
You're so beautiful to mewizard needs food, badly

I know that you're probably mad at me
I've come to expect that
you know that you'll never have all of me
you've come to resent that
you say "tomato", I say "video games"
you're acting so solemn
you'll take the precious remote control from me
do I sound like Gollum?
not that I'm escaping
you charm me like the flame does moths
it's just that you'd prefer me docile
like a narcoleptic sloth

the wizard needs food badly
the Voltron can't be incomplete
the things I love, you hate so madly
I must not go down in defeat

In the hunter-gatherer societies
I'd bring home the bacon
Public thought says men should try and be tame
Stirred but not shaken
I say "baseball" then you start to cry
I'm sorry I grieve you
I think a motorcycle's a good way to die
This must bereave you

I know that you try so hard
And I'm not saying it's a sin
It's just that they don't feel my pain
In Vogue or Cosmopolitan

the wizard needs food badly
the Voltron can't be incomplete
the things I love, you hate so madly
I must not go down in defeat

and I'm sure you have your reasons
but listen to me please…

I want the G.I. Joe with the Kung-Fu action grip
I want Nintendo with the extra-graphics-microchip
tackle football with rocks, and sticks, and knives, and pain
I want the truck with the four wheel drive train
you'd rather see me get good at bookkeepping
I could clean house in the time that I'm not sleeping
I live to serve you, and I don't want to be rude
but you should see that the wizard needs food

the wizard needs food badly
the Voltron can't be incomplete
the things I love, you hate so madly
I must not go down in defeat

wizard is about to dieyou said, "down with the church", with your fists up in the air
all the rancor and the hate, yeah we saw your frigid stare
you hate Christianity, but love your animosity
it's the church who's getting rotten, yet it's Christ that you've forgotten

goodnight, goodbye, farewell to arms, it's time
goodnight, goodbye, farewell to arms, it's time

lay down your hate, (the burden and) the weight will disappear
if you could separate your anger, from that still small voice you hear

clench your fists and grit your teeth, save forgiveness for the weak
let your bitterness consume, let the salt rub in your wounds
you have saved up all your spite, stoked the flame that keeps the fight
it's so hard to be objective, when your reason is defective

goodnight, goodbye, farewell to arms, it's time
goodnight, goodbye, farewell to arms, it's time

lay down your hate, (the burden and) the weight will disappear
if you could separate your anger, from that still small voice you hear

you say that you've aged, I think you're just enraged
you say that you've aged, I think you're just enraged

goodnight, goodbye, farewell to arms, it's time
goodnight, goodbye, farewell to arms, it's time

Who incited, what ignited, all this hatred, say farewell to arms
(Goodnight, goodbye, farewell to arms, it's time.)
Broken hearted, dearly departed, maybe we should say farewell to arms
(Goodnight, goodbye, farewell to arms, it's time.)it’s been a long time...

cancellation! devastation! deviation! expiration!
cancellation! devastation! deviation! expiration!

I've got pocketfuls of crumpled receipts
just about enough to start a fire
I'll watch the past just burn away
put the mic stand through the amplifier
put the bass down, bass down, one time
snap the neck now. drum set, smash it
kick the kick drum, one time, kicked in
smashed up, break it, break up

see the flames begin to crawl, upward
taste the anguish as they fall, unheard

cancellation! devastation! deviation! expiration!
cancellation! devastation! deviation! expiration!

I've got notebooks full of misshapen words
I'll never speak them anymore
ten years from now, you won't know my name
throw the microphone down on the floor
yeah 

put the guitar, guitar, one time
through the speaker, splintered, broken
throw the horns down, one time, horns down
smash them, break them, break up

see the flames begin to crawl, upward
taste the anguish as they fall, unheard
hear the record start to skip, unsung
feel the weight that sunk the ship, so young

the crowds recoil, demand our survival
fists in the air, mouths caked with saliva
but you are the one, the spark that was spawned
who picks up the pieces, and passes it on

see the flames begin to crawl, upward
taste the anguish as they fall, unheard
hear the record start to skip, unsung
feel the weight that sunk the ship, so youngan idea dies, in the same slight way
that we lose track of the facts
slowly, unseen, slipping silently
through some fabricated cracks
and now the freedom of the press
has turned to freedom to impress
perfect hair, sells product well
like suffocating, sickly smells
the make-up smears, like false pastels
like glossy, sugarcoated, shells

tune in, tune out, goodbye, goodnight
they're buying you with fear and lies
turn it off until it's right
that's the news, that's all, goodnight
turn it off until it's right
that's the news, that's all, goodnight

the advertising dollars buy
the right to stifle antonyms
to sterilize the truth with fiction
so we can sing their corporate hymns

and all of us were cowed and bought it
hardly anybody got it
while mergers made their spires grow taller
what they let you know grew smaller
and we were scared, or too bemused
and so we still turned on the news

tune in, tune out, goodbye, goodnight
they're buying you with fear and lies
turn it off until it's right
that's the news, that's all, goodnight
turn it off until it's right
that's the news, that's all


are you afraid yet?
they want you to be
it will keep you coming back
you are a loyal customer
are you afraid yet?
you should be

tune in, tune out, goodbye, goodnight
they're buying you with fear and lies
turn it off until it's right
that's the news, that's all, goodnight
turn it off until it's right
that's the news, that's all

goodnight
people say they know a girl
who's lost her way, she's always angry
no one bothers to ask her
what she hears or what she hopes for
the air is cold, she lives alone
and tires of being her only provider
she can't fathom grace tonight
so not tonight, it's not an option

searching for more than mere tastes of living water
tired eyes tend to wander, seek the light

create in her a sense of awe that sees Your beauty
let Your splendor flash with blinding light

cities slowly suffocate
what once was bright is now moth-eaten
as young girls filter thoughts that once were
fresh now worn and beaten
clutching pity like a prize
to her side her fingers grow weary
he cares so much for sparrows
won't He toss something out my way?

searching for more than mere lies disguised as dogma
tired eyes tend to wander, seek the light

create in her a sense of awe that sees Your beauty
let Your splendor flash with blinding light
standing tall, all the aspen trees drink water
as rain falls down like laughter from the sky

create in her a sense of awe that sees Your beauty
let Your splendor flash with blinding light

once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered weak and weary
suddenly there came a tapping, as of someone gently rapping
long ago I heard that sound, often lost, but seldom found
a haunting voice from minutes past, Micah had returned at last

and I was like, "what's up dude?"
and he was like, "uhhh, I found your comb."
and then I was like, “shut up!"
and then he was like, "yeah, and stuff."
and then I was like, "rock on!"

and that's how the story ends
now you’ll hear the score my friends
we're finding answers, we're setting trends
I guess that's how the story ends

how distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December
and each dying ember, wrought its ghost upon the floor
I heard a voice that chilled my spine, I saw what I could not define
a sight I never could contrive, there stood Brad at last, alive
"where have you been these endless years?"
I asked him, sobbing through my tears
"I did not die by plague or prison
what really died is cynicism."

and then I said, "awesome."
and he was like, "yeah, I guess
and by the way, those pants, they belong to my dad
and they're not really pants, they're leiderhosen." hooray!

and that's how the story ends
now you’ll hear the score my friends
we're finding answers, we're setting trends
I guess that's how the story ends

and Combat Chuck has passed away
his dying wish was "never play that song again"
and kitty-doggy's put to sleep, the dinosaurs lay in a heap
as they slowly go extinct, like me

and that's how the story ends
now you’ll hear the score my friends
we're finding answers, we're setting trends
I guess that's how the story ends
I have been scarred so deep by life and cold despair
and brittle bones were broken far beyond repair
I have leveled lies so deep, the truth may never find
and inside my faithless heart, I stole things never mine

if mercy falls upon the broken and the poor
dear Father, I will see You, there on distant shores

I have toiled for countless years and ever felt the cost
and I've been burned by this world's cold
like leaves beneath the frost
on my knees I've crawled to You, bleeding myself dry
but the price of life is more, than I could ever buy

if mercy falls upon the broken and the poor
dear Father, I will see You, there on distant shores

and off of the blocks, I was headstrong and proud
at the front of the line for the card-carrying, highbrowed
with both eyes fastened tight, yet unscarred from the fight
running at full tilt, my sword pulled from its hilt
it's funny how these things can slip away, our frail deeds
the last will wave good-bye
it's funny how the hope will bleed away
the citadels we build and fortify. good-bye

night came and I broke my stride
I swallowed hard, but never cried
when grace was easy to forget
I'd denounce the hypocrites
casting first stones, killing my own
and You would unscale my blind eyes
and I stood battered, but more wise
fighting to accelerate
shaking free from crippling weight
with resilience unsurpassed
I clawed my way to You at last
and on my knees, I wept at Your feet
I finally believed, that You still loved me

healing hands of God
have mercy on our unclean souls once again
Jesus Christ, Light of the World
burning bright within our hearts forever
freedom means love without condition
without beginning or an end
here's my heart, let it be forever Yours
only You can make every new day seem so new
