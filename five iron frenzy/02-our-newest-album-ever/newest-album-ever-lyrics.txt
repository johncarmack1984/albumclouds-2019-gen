you found a way, to draw a line
between the world and you
faking your identity its true. Did
you think the word "alternative"
was only meant for the likes of
you? do you think that they're too
cool now? being popular is lame
you're the one who made them popular
all their songs are still the same

you found them first, it made you
stand apart, you know? But then
everyone jumped on the same
bandwagon, making you and
average Joe. A lemming for the
mediocre, you were just a plain
old joker, status quo. blame it on
the band now. If you prick them
do they bleed? what's the point in
playing what they want, if you
won't let them succeed?

do you remember where we all
came from? do you remember
what it's all about? when you
made a point to be objective
before you started writing
handbook for the sellout?

you sunk your worth in being
different, just to be like your own
kind. you traded in objectiveness
for the underground you follow
blind

do you remember where we all
came from? do you remember
what it's all about? when you
made a point to be objective
before you started writing
handbook for the sellout?it's five minutes from the show
so where the heck did Micah go?
I don't know, he's not around
I didn't hear him make a sound
his whereabouts we could not find
I think we left him behind
have you seen him?

Micah, where did Micah go?
Micah, should be at our show
Micah, guess that we should find him
Micah, 'cause we kind of like him here

poor John Walsh his heart is bleeding
"have you seen me?
milk jugs reading:
does this face ring a bell
is he lost inside some well?
I think we left him at the show
I think we left him in Toledo
have you seen him?

Micah, where did Micah go?
Micah, should be at our show
Micah, guess that we should find him
Micah, 'cause we kind of like him

we've got a roll of duct-tape for the next time he tries to run away
come on Micah, it's time for your feeding
do you want another senseless beating?

Micah, where did Micah go?
Micah, should be at our show
Micah, guess that we should find him
Micah, 'cause we kind of like him herebacon bits and jalapeños on my polish hot dog
half a pound of potato chips, and a beef jerky log
I press my face to the window
a wrapper sticks to my shirt
eight people in a stinky van
a couple more couldn't hurt

eat some food off the floor
I've developed a taste for bread mold
ride around in a van
don't take a shower for six weeks and

we've been given superpowers
ask us for an autograph
we sing, we dance, we'll make you laugh
don't you want to be like us?

everyone in the band can't stand me
just because I fell off the stage
and kind of by accident
I broke the promoter's legs
sometimes we have a deadline, for writing our songs
five minutes left to write this one
la, la, la, la, la, la, la la

sleep in a sleeping bag
every floor looks the same as last night
you wake up
you drive
you play a show
and then you sleep again

we've been given superpowers
ask us for an autograph
we sing, we dance, we'll make you laugh
don't you want to be like us?

we've been given super powers
ask about our rock and roll
our hair, our clothes, hobbies, and pets
does he have a girlfriend yet?
I sometimes feel like I'm Holden Caufield
sometimes Jack Kerouac
I wanted to be famous, now I want to take it back

don't want to rock the mic
don't want to meet the pope
I just want to share with you
how we got this peace and hope

we've been given superpowers
ask us for an autograph
we've been given superpowers
ask us for an autograph

I once wanted to be famous
now I want to take it back
I once wanted to be famous
now I want to take it backup from the sands of the mighty Sahara comes
our hero bold, who so it's told
is a lot like you and me
his passion burns, the world it turns
he fills his hand to fill the void
and fuels the constant feeling
of nothingness inside his soul

feels like nothing ever did
kills like nothing ever could
dark and jaded world I hated
everything I left behind
I don't need you, and I don't want you
world that left me blind

beneath the sands of the mighty Sahara lies
buried treasure sunken deep
in darkened tombs where dead men sleep
gold fills hands, or is it sand
the same that covers everything?
where cities stood, soon deserts found
now sink beneath the swelling ground

feels like nothing ever did
kills like nothing ever could
dark and jaded world I hated
everything I left behind
I don't need you, and I don't want you
world that left me blind

this world is for the taking
this world is suffocating

plastic bags of novocain
some PCP to kill the pain
you build a tomb to store your rust
moth-eaten piles of blowing dust

under the sands of the mighty Sahara
goes our hero bold, in seach of gold
a casket for a dying world
our hero stands, with wealth in hand
the prize for his endeavors
the masses cheer, to hide their fears
that no man lives forever

feels like nothing ever did
kills like nothing ever could
dark and jaded world I hated
everything I left behind
I don't want you, and I don't need you
world that left me blindcoke bottle glasses
I'm sitting in the corner with my finger up my nose
and my shoelaces untied again
another day of school with no friends (whoa-oh, whoa-oh)
a social outcast
two grades ahead in math
with my high-water pants
giving meaning to pencil-necked-geek
a dork or so to speak, tongue-in-cheek

they're all suckerpunching me
get in line for a wedgie
all I want and all I need
Is someone who believes in me

a song sung for underdogs
for all the left out
a flag flying for losers
somewhere in the heavens
the God of ever-lasting comfort
believed in me
loved me when I was faithless
He still died for me

junior high schooler
with pencils in my pockets
and my Trapper Keeper busted
spilling papers and books on the floor
not wanting seventh grade anymore (whoa-oh, whoa-oh)
another class-clown
acting like a goof to be accepted by my peers
giving meaning to pencil-necked-geek
a dork or so to speak, tongue in cheek

they're all sucker-punching me
get in line for a wedgie
all I want and all I need
is someone who believes in me

a song sung for underdogs
for all the left out
a flag flying for losers
somewhere in the heavens
the God of ever-lasting comfort
believed in me
loved me when I was faithless
He still died for me

a song sung for underdogs

Five Iron Frenzy, thanks a lot

kitty doggy, you're the one
you're the one I want for today
yeah, I need you kitty doggy
yeah, I love you
you're my kitty, you're my doggy
You're my kitty and my doggy
kitty doggy I love you
kitty doggy kitty doggy I love you
you make me feel like school
something brand new
some hair that's in my shoe
I have a hot kittysummer of 1978
my sister and I in the back seat just wait
we pass the time by making lines in the seat that we can't cross
a thin line like dental floss

she threw my new blue comb out the window, somewhere on I-70
dad said, "I'm sorry, but we can't go back,"
we're never going back to get it
it was the first comb I ever had
got it just that morning from my mom and my dad
light blue in color, I could never have another
comb like that, big and fat…

so tell me, have you seen my comb?
last time I saw it, it was in her hands
and then it was bouncing down the road
it wasn't fancy, it wasn't brown
but now it might be from lying on the ground
so tell me, have you seen my comb?

driving down the road in September
I was only five but I still remember
where the highway turns at the bottom of the hill
my parents both up front 'cause they loved each other still
maybe just a comb made of plastic
or an action of a sibling lacking couth
but something that was thrown out that window
was the last great symbol of my youth

have you seen my comb?
last time I saw it, it was in her hands
and then it was bouncing down the road
it wasn't fancy, it wasn't brown
but now it might be from lying on the ground
so tell me, have you seen my comb?a banner year 1864
don't want the red man anymore
can't have them taking up good land
give them a token flag
trade pipes and shake some hands
tell them the white stripes stand for peace
say if they raise red white and blue
blue coats will never shoot at you
but stripes will loose their sheen
black Kettle was their chief
he only wanted peace
under the flag...a massacre at Sand Creek

wave your flag. Salivate
stirring feelings of pride and hate
a peace of cloth can't hold your faith

no flag flies, no banner waves
see the empty pole above his empty grave
no one knows where he lies
and no one know just why he had to die

a banner year 1868
a bitter end a twist of fate
maps won't hold this melanoma
blurry part of Oklahoma
where Custer shot and killed Black Kettle

wave your flag. Salivate
stirring feelings of pride and hate
a peace of cloth can't hold your faith

no flag flies, no banner waves
see the empty pole above his empty grave
no one knows where he lies
and no one know just why he had to die

a promise is a promise
a judge of character
his banner over me is love

no flag flies, no banner waves
see the empty pole above his empty grave
no one knows where he lies
and no one know just why he had to die
no flag flies, no banner waves
see the empty pole above his empty grave
no one knows where he lies
and no one know just why he had to dieI wonder if these minutes were my last
If I should choose to feast or start to fast

would I pray or would I curse
hope for good or something worse?
what emotion would I feel?
would I run or would I kneel?

time is winding down but only for this life
I want to be found enjoying the next life
I see leaves and they are starting to turn brown
but they'll be green and growing when the second season comes around

the strongest will expire just the same
the quick will fall exactly like the lame

I'll do nothing at the most
to keep from giving up the ghost
try to make my shoulders broad
but I am helpless without God

time is winding down but only for this life
I want to be found enjoying the next life
I see leaves and they are starting to turn brown
they'll be green and growing when the second season comes around

I may try to grip control
but when for me shall this bell toll?
if the answer is to bow
to him that makes how soon is now

time is winding down but only for this life
I want to be found enjoying the next life
I see leaves and they are starting to turn brown
they'll be green and growing when the second season comes arounddisturbed by the words and the message that they sent
there's a hundred other uses for breath better spent
forming the template, for how the band should be
devising and scheming someone else's ministry
what were the words?
did he say Jesus Christ?
again and again until his name became trite?

what is the extent of all your tests?
what is the measure of their success?

not acid or base to test in a beaker
hold your divining rod up to the speaker
litmus test a piece of paper
you'll never formulate your maker

with pocketfuls of quips and gurgles
words that fluff like a handful of gerbils
I heard your yelling above the crowd
standing in the back with the arrogant and proud
you say preach, they say rock
you put my God inside a box

what is the extent of all your tests?
what is the measure of their success?

not acid or base to test in a beaker
hold your divining rod up to the speaker
litmus test a piece of paper
you'll never formulate your maker

the time has come, the night to end
so speak your piece to your circle of friends
they ripped you off, they entertained
they never tried to ease your pain
you thought you knew where God belonged
but songs were sung and the band played on

litmus test a piece of paper
you'll never formulate your makerwelcome to Canada, it's the maple leaf state
Canada, oh, Canada, it's great
the people are nice there, they speak French too
if you don't like it man, you sniff glue
the great white north, their kilts are plaid
hosers take off, it's not that bad

I want to be where yaks can run free
where the Royal Mounties can arrest me

let's go to Canada
let's leave today
Canada, oh Canada
I s'il vous plait

they've got trees and mooses and sled dogs
lots of lumber and lumberjacks and logs!
you may think that's kind of a drag
but you have to go there to get milk in a bag
they say "eh" instead of "what" or "duh"
that's the mighty power of Canada

I want to be where lemmings run into the sea
where the marmosets can attack me

let's go to Canada
let's leave today
Canada, oh Canada
I s'il vous plait

Let's go to Canada
Let's leave today
Canada, oh Canada
I s'il vous plait

please, please explain to me
how this all has come to be
we forgot to mention something here
did we say that William Shatner is a native citizen
and slurpees made from venison
that's deer!

let's go to Canada
let's leave today
Canada, oh Canada
I s'il vous plait

let's go to Canada
let's leave today
Canada, oh Canada
I s'il vous plaitoverzealous, to say the least
underestimated how far you could reach
how could we know how far you'd go?
behind our backs to make sure
your point is heard, you're
you're better than us all

does it really matter how far you go?
can you get some sleep now, standing on so many toes?

who we are

do what you do when you say what you wanna say
with or without regard for me
scheme what you scheme when you're thinking of yourself
you're the most likely to succeed

now that my purpose has been served
make a caste system for the modern world
your motto rings, "Tomorrow brings
another life to underrate
to belittle and humiliate”

does it really matter how far you go?
can you get some sleep now, standing on so many toes?

do what you do when you say what you wanna say
with or without regard for me
scheme what you scheme when you're thinking of yourself
you're the most likely to succeed
yearbook said that you'd be another winner
you forgot what success should mean
poster child for becoming homeless
Mr. most likely to succeed

and as you go
call to mind the things you've come to know
be sure to wave goodbye
on the day you die
to all that you've wanted, you're leaving behind

do what you do when you say what you wanna say
with or without regard for me
scheme what you scheme when you're thinking of yourself
you're the most likely to succeed
yearbook said that you'd be another winner
you forgot what success should mean
poster child for becoming homeless
Mr. most likely to succeedha ha

when I was young, the smallest trick of light
could catch my eye
then life was new and every new day
I thought that I could fly
I believed in what I hoped for
and I hoped for things unseen
I had wings and dreams could soar
I just don't feel like flying anymore

when the stars threw down their spears
watered Heaven with their tears
before words were spoken
before eternity

Dear Father, I need You
Your strength my heart to mend
I want to fly higher
every new day again

when I was small, the furthest I could reach
was not so high
then I thought the world was so much smaller
feeling that I could fly
through distant deeps and skies
behind infinity
below the face of Heaven
He stoops to create me

Dear Father, I need You
Your strength my heart to mend
I want to fly higher
every new day again

man versus himself
man versus machine
man versus the world
mankind versus me
the struggles go on
the wisdom I lack
the burdens keep piling
up on my back
so hard to breathe
to take the next step
the mountain is high
I wait in the depths
yearning for grace
and hoping for peace
Dear God
increase

healing hands of God have mercy on our unclean souls once again
Jesus Christ, light of the world burning bright within our hearts forever
freedom means love without condition, without a beginning or an end
here's my heart, let it be forever yours
only you can make every new day seem so newthis song is the godzilla song

yes yes go ready play
