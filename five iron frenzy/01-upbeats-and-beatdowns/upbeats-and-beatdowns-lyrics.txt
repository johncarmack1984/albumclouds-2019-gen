some cowboys were a riding, riding on the range;
the grass was over grazed there, and spotted like some mange;
the buffalo were dead there, the trees they all were through
and if they saw some Injuns, why they would kill them too

kill them too
they would kill them too

west or bust, in God we trust, “let us rape, let us kill, let us steal"
we can almost justify, anything we feel;
I am climbing up that ladder, more brownie points for me
I will work my way to Jesus you wait and see

said one cowboy to another, "I think it would be nice
if we could take these injuns and convert them all to Christ;
see, they are all disgusting, and bringing me great pain
and if they do not believe me, we will put a bullet in their brains!”

put a bullet in their brain

west or bust, in God we trust, “let us rape, let us kill, let us steal"
we can almost justify, anything we feel;
I am climbing up that ladder, more brownie points for me
I will work my way to Jesus you wait and see

I am always shouting, when I go outside
how people should repent now, or they are going to die
my motives are all selfish, I am a cannon brimmed with powder
if people do not believe me, I just beat them and yell louder

west or bust, in God we trust, “let us rape, let us kill, let us steal"
we can almost justify, anything we feel;
I am climbing up that ladder, more brownie points for me
I will work my way to Jesus you wait wait and seemy car broke down in Arizona
have to ride the bus again
at ten-o-clock on Tuesday night
with thirteen cents and a broken pen
I put my backpack on the bench
tell two people I do not smoke
see the cop across the street
he thinks that I am selling dope

I could have walked another block
to get away from the scene
why does it always come to this
where zero meets fifteen?

and so I gave my thirteen cents
to the man who peed his pants
he passes out and falls on me
I watch my change fall from his hand
I see the lady next to me
holds her baby black blue
the junkie gutter-punks keeps asking
where I got my new tattoo

what does it matter anyway
thirteen cents or all I own?
how can I ever save the world
on cup-o-soup and student loans?

I want to try and save the world
but it never goes that way
god I do not know what to do
down at Colfax and Broadway

now the man with no shoes on
says I do not know how to play
he says I fumble all the time
he thinks that I am John Elway
I put my face down in my hands
water wells inside my eyes
what do I have to give them?
does it matter if I try?

I can not stand to see you suffer
I try to intellectualize
a formula to end you pain
it does not work
God knows I have tried

I want to try and save the world
but it never goes that way
God I do not know what to do
down at Colfax and Broadway

sometimes my cup is overfilled
sometimes I am too afraid that I am going to spill

I want to try and save the world
but it never goes that way
God I do not know what to do
down at Colfax and Broadwaywhat could this be, too much MTV?
chalk another fad up for its fall into infamy
what is in a standard if it changes all the time?
you are still having trouble in defining your own kind
need I remind you, we all knew you before
you threw the rocks at the stage from your glass house on the floor?
now I think you are punk, just because it is in
you found a foul mouth and a couple safety pins

got a peaceful feeling
I do not want to fight no more
got a peaceful feeling
I do not care if we are punk, or ska, or hardcore
enough for you, it is sad but true
you can call us names till your face turns blue
our assurance comes from God
it is nothing new
we will never care 'cause we are never cool enough for you

that smug look on your face
your nose up in the air
your patches say you are open-minded
but still you could not bear
some punk thrown in with ska
you said it would not work
well you can take your Vespa home 'cause ska made you a jerk
the purist turns a deaf ear
he is such an intellect
does he think his censorship is gaining our respect?
the raising of a fist, like a trigger of a gun
stop and see we are all alike, and we can dance as one

got a peaceful feeling
I do not want to fight no more
got a peaceful feeling
I do not care if we are punk, or ska, or hardcore
enough for you, it is sad but true
you can call us names till your face turns blue
our assurance comes from God
it is nothing new
we will never care 'cause we are never cool enough for you

got a peaceful feeling
I do not want to fight no more
got a peaceful feeling
I do not care if we are punk or ska or hardcore

laa nation stands with heart in hand
to sing their anthem proudly
voices raised to sing their praise
of their hollow country
all this talk of freedom
and some talk of liberty
from your plastic podium
you try and convince me

I can not fall anymore
for some silver-tongued song
your freedom is not free
so let me say what freedom means to

I can not see red, white, and blue waving in the air
I do not hear the bombs bursting and I do not even care
I am sorry for my lack of faith
I am not the greatest patriot
if this is all their is to freedom I do not want it

I can not fall anymore
for some silver-tongued song
your freedom is not free
so let me say what freedom means to

pushing us a drug that you call freedom and democracy
promise us that selfishness is the means for happiness
I burned that bridge so long ago that I can hardly see
anything but solace in what freedom means to me

I can not fall anymore
for some silver-tongued song
freedom is not free
so let me say what freedom means to

it cannot mean to serve ourselves
that does not mean a thing
it does not mean to give the license
to seek ourselves in anything
that would be slavery to ourselves it is not free
Jesus Christ, the only thing that freedom means to methrough this mirrored image feeling
was my head so oddly reeling
not aware of floor or ceiling
kneeling and crying 

all the past I would spent denying
watching others lose in trying
the time I wasted spent in crying
where could truth be found?

joy could not be found in money
do not put your faith in somebody
not in attempts to be funny
life seems incomplete

why doubt the life He offers
when all the world is not enough?
who knows if we have got time
we cannot wait 'till it is too late

searching for someone else to blame
hoping I will not go insane
selfish pride my only gain
faking sanity

the charade said I was fine
knowing riches would be mine
I chose to face the cross the sign
I gave my future up

joy could not be found in money
do not put your faith in somebody
not in attempts to be funny
life seems incomplete

why doubt the life He offers
when all the world is not enough?
who knows if we have got time
we cannot wait 'till it is too lateshut upstraight from the ghetto streets of
Harlem, came two brothers Willis
and Arnold, black goldfish swims
in the bowl, he is three feet high
four with the afro. Stealing
cookies from the jar
dropping water balloons on cars
I hope Mrs.. Garret will not see
just play sick for Mohammed Ali

the Gooch is coming, to steal
milk money

Arnold, and Willis, and Mr
Drumond, and do not forget
Kimberly. they just cancelled
Dukes of Hazard, Different
Strokes is all I want to see

way up high in the penthouse
apartment, making us laugh its
Willis and Arnold. Mr
Drumond has got the dough, they
get to ride in a limo

Different Strokes, its almost time
we just watch 'cause Kimberly is
fine. Half hour long it never fills
us, when he says, "what you
talkin' 'bout willis?". write the
cable company, different strokes
all the time

Arnold, and Willis, and Mr
Drumond, and do not forget
Kimberly. they just cancelled
Dukes of Hazard, Different
Strokes is all I want to see

Mr. Drummond a man of the means, loves two black brothers they have only got the blue jeans

Mr. Drummond a man of the means, loves two black brothers they have only got the blue jeans gofeel

the air is so clear, the sky is so
blue, I know what you mean, I feel
lucky too. I found a dollar, it is like
a dream. I love this place, my slurpee is
so green

so much easier to think we did this all
ourselves, so much easier to let our hearts
do what they have felt. so much easier to steal 
from God than take the blame to throw our chips up in
the air, and let the praise fall where it may
I feel, I feel lucky

it is a well known fact, our hearts are black
a maze full of mice, a game of cosmic dice
a never-ending quiz, is all you think this
is. a gaping black hole, all the glory that
you stole

there is no such thing as luck

so much easier to think we did this all
ourselves, so much easier to let our hearts
do what they have felt. so much easier to steal 
from God than take the blame to throw our chips up in
the air, and let the praise fall where it may

I feel , I feel lucky
I feel , I feel lucky
today
if I had a nickel for every single time
I have tried to classify the populace around me with a word
or a catchy phrase, I could quit my job for good
and play Nintendo until my fingers ached

am I an idiot, too lazy to think twice?
I point the finger, but I can not take my own advice
I put a name on something and ever since
I have made an art of building my counterfeit intelligence

seemingly to me
I am straightening a world of cluttered thoughts
and debris inside of my head
but I think instead of prejudiced
and I give people names to make me feel safe

am I an idiot, too lazy to think twice?
I point the finger, but I can not take my own advice
I put a name on something and ever since
I have made an art of building my counterfeit intelligence

how does it feel what does it take to make me understand?
if I could only walk a mile in the shoes of another man
if I could look out through his eyes
and know what it means to bleed the same red blood that I do

what is economic status, and tell me what is race?
who decides to classify taxonomy of grace?
if one man gets less than another is it true
that he is all that different
that he is less than you?the man on the television said I
need to drink this, and sleep with
that, in order to be cool. and
you know that I would do almost
anything, to be like that guy on
TV. I know that if I had just the
right outfit and hairstyle that
could be me. do not you know
you can not be cool if you dress
dumb, I need to have that 'cause
everybody has got one. I think I will
start smoking, that would make
me intellectual, that is what I have
always wanted to be. I need to
lift weights, that would make me
more sexual, and that would be so
good for me

in America it is wonderful, all
you have to do is fake it. own
anything you want, all you
have to do is take it. live for
today, do not think about
tomorrow, have a good time in
America-Gomorrah

what are you looking at, you
better not make me mad. I will drive
by your house and shoot your
dog, and mom, and dad. I do not
need you or the Bible or anything
to tell me what is the law. with a
good enough lawyer I can do
anything in Beautiful America

in America it is wonderful, all
you have to do is fake it. own
anything you want, all you
have to do is take it. live for
today, do not think about
tomorrow, have a good time in
America-Gomorrah

I want to be in America
okay, For me in America
everything is free in America
for a small fee in America

I want to be in America
okay, For me in America
everything is free in America
for a small fee in America

I want to be in America

aw yeah

blahhey everybody this is Combat Chuck and I love this song because it is about me

a real life superhero
he has got the Holy Ghost
he is either praising Jesus
or he is making toast
aint got no superpowers
aint got no giant brain
but he would try and help you
if he heard you call his name

there is some kids there in some trouble
need a Pepsi on the double
then he shouts, not so quiet
"would you like regular or diet?"
found a campsite for some kids
by the stage is what he did
people ask why he is so nice
he wants to be like Jesus Christ

go go go go go go go go

whenever you are in trouble
whenever you are in need
Combat Chuck will help you
he nearly runs with speed
he is on the ball to save the masses
got some thick old horn-rimmed glasses
his head is bald, he shaved it shiny
kicks the devil in his hiney
found a campsite for the kids
by the stage is what he did
people ask why he is so nice
he wants to be like Jesus Christ

Combat Chuck

doo doo doo doo

you have got a cause now, I heard you bragging
always the fastest one on the bandwagon
so sit down and I will tell you, what I am feeling, what I am feeling
for lack of better words you are stealing, you are stealing
all of my joy away from me
whatever happened to our unity?

we cut ourselves, wounds we have severed
it is time for us to pull together, and stand, as one
all eyes are turning towards the Son now
drop your fists now, what you resent
let us not forget who we represent
and fall to our knees in unity

another day now, another doctrine
another monkey wrench in the system
some folks kneeling, some just listen
some falling our of the pews from twisting
I do not care kids, how you do it
united we stand, we can pull through it
all were dead once. all enslaved
now pull together because we have all been saved

we cut ourselves, wounds we have severed
it is time for us to pull together, and stand, as one
all eyes are turning towards the Son now
drop your fists now, what you resent
let us not forget who we represent
and fall to our knees in unity

the only Jesus this world is gonna see
is the Jesus in you and me
so pick your cross up, stop your swinging
stop and look at the stink you are bringing
to this body with your fighting
you bust more knuckles than the wrongs you are righting
what is important is where we relate
it is the meaning of the word Amalgamate

we cut ourselves, wounds we have severed
it is time for us to pull together, and stand, as one
all eyes are turning towards the Son now
drop your fists now, what you resent
let us not forget who we represent
and fall to our knees in unityI was wasting time
oh so sure to find somebody who
would never go
how could I know
none I had found was true
none could be but you
the only one love divine
my heart, my mind are yours

everywhere I go I see your face through the crowd
everywhere I go I hear your voice clear and loud
everywhere I go you are the light that I seek
everywhere I go you have found me

where could my heart go
where you would not be
where you would not know to find me?
far, far from here
still you are near
still you are near to me
and I see

everywhere I go I see your face through the crowd
everywhere I go I hear your voice clear and loud
everywhere I go you are the light that I seek
everywhere I go you have found me

I have seen you in the morning in the guiding light you hold me closer than the air around me you surround me always

everywhere I go I see your face through the crowd
everywhere I go I hear your voice clear and loud
everywhere I go you are the light that I seek
everywhere I go you have found me

blahbeautiful day, wonderful feeling
I feel like singing, Psalms
meaning songs singing praises
all day long. Joy fills the weak
joy makes us strong. Filled 'till we
burst, songs of praise to the God
of the Universe

despite our selfish selves
despite all loss of hope
despite our lack of faith
despite our stony hearts
despite the waning moon
despite the ebbing tide of how we think this world should be

praise God from whom all blessings flow
praise Him all creatures here below
praise Him above ye heavenly host
praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost

gray rainy day
down in the mud for us
do not feel I can sing
songs to the God in control of the Seasons
what is good and bad
flow from the hands
of the God with the perfect plan
filled with joy all of this will glorify

despite our selfish selves
despite all loss of hope
despite our lack of faith
despite our stony hearts
despite the waning moon
despite the ebbing tide of how we think this world should be

praise God from whom all blessings flow
praise Him all creatures here below
praise Him above ye heavenly host
praise Father, Son, and Holy Ghost

praise God from whom all blessings flow
praise Him all creatures here below
praise Him above ye heavenly host
praise Father, Son, and Holy GhostI walked into the room, and she was right there waiting
leaning up against the bar
well she was perpertraiting
slick as snot her spandex
and blacker than some coal
she set her gaze upon my bootie
with disco in her soul
so much for indecision
so quick did she decide
the temptress with her doors open inviting me inside
"I want to take you home with me"
said the sparkle in her eye
"I would like to honey, but I am about to die.”

I have got a time bomb
I strapped it to my chest
when it blows I am out of here
you can have what is left

the room got kind of quiet
and you could smell the fear
I only heard the jukebox play "A Tear is in My Beer"
"so what is the verdict Mister?
when is it gonna blow?"
I just winked at her and said
"darlin I do not know.”

time-bomb ticking in the room
everybody goes someday
blows so fast you better be
somewhere where it is safe
thin skinned thread-bare thinking
now you are gonna die
do not try to rock the jukebox
just kiss this world good-bye

I have got a time bomb
I strapped it to my chest
when it blows I am out of here
you can have what is left

what is the deal, do not you feel
alone now in the silence?
pushing up the daisies now
there is better ways for you to diet
seeking after sucker wealth
suckers feel what suckers dealt
all your life you stuffed your face
now you are dead I rest my case
got a story here to tell
so you better listen well
some old lady in a church
got a nickel in her purse
you were rich, she was poor
you dropped some fifties on the floor
she dropped her nickel with a clank
she was thinking third world think tank

the Karaoke master
the drunkard
and the jerk
ditch this sorry world and all its worth
keep your candle burning
waiting for the time
ready to explode
the bomb is primed

I have got a time bomb
I strapped it to my chest
when it blows I am out of here
you can have what is leftTuesday one fifty one p.m.
