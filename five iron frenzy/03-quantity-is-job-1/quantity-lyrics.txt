I have an evil plan to save the world for every man
and I think it's better than the way it's being run
oh the groundwork's laid
no, don't be afraid
I'm sure that I can fix it
when I figure out the physics

my evil plan to save the world
just you wait 'till it's unfurled
it'll go down in history
it's prophetic
no, it's not pathetic
I can't believe I made it up myself

I have an evil plan
to save the world you understand
the exemplary feat
you'd think I'd have to cheat
I'd make Voltaire proud
deep and furrow browed
uncanny and so clever
it's "our newest plan ever!”

got tired of whining
a grander scheme with silver lining
for every boy and girl
we can't be responsible
for all that's wrong with this world

my evil plan to save the world
just you wait 'till it's unfurled
it'll go down in history
it's prophetic
no, it's not pathetic
I can't believe I made it up myself

starving children in pain
you can't believe in that god
the world's not spinning your way
does every dog still have his day?

my evil plan to save the world
just you wait 'till it's unfurled
it'll go down in history, yeah
it's prophetic
no, it's not pathetic
I can't believe I made it up myself

my evil plan to save the world
just you wait 'till it's unfurled
it'll go down in history
it's prophetic
no, it's not pathetic
I can't believe I made it up myself

yeahwhere does the misunderstanding come from?
demanding that we be outstanding and then some?
perfection never was a requirement although some might say
we desired it
so then for times when things get old I might get cynical
I see that I don't see
do they see You when they see me?

in honesty there's room for improvement
thoughts may change , the truth be told
a closed mind will leave you empty
use your mind to use your soul

alert the press, their dogmas are a mess
opinions shift, a broken sift, an empty hand
and billboards ask, "where do they stand."
do all streams lead to one sea?

logically there's room for all questions
though the answers aren't all known
objectivity's the myth of plenty
who doubt His truth within their soul

in honesty there's room for improvement
thoughts may change , the truth be told
a closed mind will leave you empty
use your mind to use your soulin a field of yellow flowers underneath the sun
bluest eyes that spark with lightning; boy with shoes undone
he is young, so full of hope reveling in tiny dreams
filling up his arms with flowers right for giving any queen

running to her, beaming bright while cradling his prize
a flickering of yellow light within his mother's eyes
she holds them to her heart keeping them where they'll be safe
clasped within her very marrow, dandelions in a vase

she sees love where anyone else would see weeds
all hope is found, here is everything he needs

fathomless Your endless mercy weight I could not lift
where do I fit in this puzzle? What good are these gifts?
not a martyr or a saint
scarcely can I struggle through
all that I have ever wanted was to give my best to You

Lord search my heart create in me something clean
dandelions: You see flowers in these weeds

gently lifting hands to heaven
softened by the sweetest hush
a Father sings over His children
loving them so very much
more than words could warrant
deeper than the darkest blue
more than sacrifice could merit
Lord, I give my heart to You

Lord search my heart create in me something clean
dandelions: You see flowers in these weeds

Lord search my heart create in me something clean
dandelions: You see flowers in these weedshere lies the old myth
breaking the mold with
truth to take away the trickery
twenty centuries of progress
suffer slowly as we regress
losing headway to ourselves
behold the covers, the sisters, the mothers
the daughters, and spouses, on the magazines
truth has been abused
how could she fill those shoes?
propaganda meant to fuel their schemes

she is strong but never silent
sure of where her strength comes from
one day, one girl army will overcome

treading the current, issues at hand
shifting, we sway, from justice and then back again
what we once broke, He has made right
lifting her up, giving birth to Jesus Christ

she is strong but never silent
sure of where her strength comes from
one day, one girl army will overcome

she is strong but never silent
sure of where her strength comes from
one day, one girl army will overcome

she is strong but never silent
sure of where her strength comes from
one day, one girl army will overcomewhere did you go?
I was searching, searching
on a one way street
I was hoping, hoping
for a chance to meet
I was waiting for the operator on the line
she's gone so long
what can I do? Where could she be?
no, no, no, don't know what I'm gonna do
I gotta get back to you

you gotta slow down, slow down
sweet talkin' woman, slow down
you got me running, run, run
you got me searching
hold on, hold on, sweet talkin' Lola
hold on, it's so sad if that's the way it's over

I was, working, many days go by
I was thinking, thinking
'bout the lonely night
communications breakdown all around
she's gone so long. What can I do?
where could she go? No, no, no
don't know what I'm gonna do
I gotta get back to you

you gotta slow down, slow down
sweet talkin' woman, slow down
you got me running, run, run
you got me searching
hold on, hold on, sweet talkin' Lola
hold on, it's so sad if that's the way it's over
slow down, slow down
sweet talkin' woman, slow down
you got me running, run, run
you got me searching
hold on, hold on, sweet talkin' Lola
hold on, it's so sad if that's the way it's over

I've been living, living, on a dead end street
I've been asking, asking, everybody I meet
insufficient data coming through
she's gone so long. What could I do?
where could she be?
no, no, no, don't know what I'm gonna do
I gotta get back to you. ohhhhhhh!

slow down, slow down
sweet talkin' woman, slow down
you got me running, run, run
you got me searching
hold on, hold on, sweet talkin' Lola
hold on, it's so sad if that's the way it's over
slow down, slow down
sweet talkin' woman, slow down
you got me running, run, run
you got me searching
hold on, hold on, sweet talkin' Lola
hold on, it's so sad if that's the way it's overwhen I go out
I play in the street
I get hit by cars
I make mashed potatoes
I get hit by carssomething stirring in the air, a victory?
a time-bomb ticking to explode
three two one and go
something passive, something not
billy clubs out, call the S.W.A.T
rabid dogs without a leash
is this how you keep the peace?

you want riots? wear your riot gear
you want violence?
then shoot some tear gas in the air

it is written on your badge
'to serve and protect'
it seemed you only served yourselves
protecting your own neck
controlling with fear, menacing and threatening
you want my respect?
you better start respecting me

go and get your riot gear
swing your girlie all around
we'll be dancing on the cinders
as the town is burning down
swing her around, burn it all down

something smelled of power tripping
crowd control was rank
tear gas everyone downtown
what you did really stank
legislation, never made you judge and jury
martial law now
beat the kids down with no worries

go and get your riot gear
swing your girlie all around
we'll be dancing on the cinders
as the town is burning down
awing her around, burn it all down

go and get your riot gear
swing that girlie all around
we'll be dancing on the cinders
as the town is burning down
swing her around, burn it all downdarb llik s’tel daed si darb

here is the tale, its spoken word-for-word
it may be abominable, but yes it must be heard
nauseating at first
you can expect the worst
so listen closely, as the plot unfolds…

I might stretch the truth
maybe a little lie
there was a boy named Brad
he played trumpet
and he died
too young for him to cease
why? We haven't got a clue
it's on the internet
so then it must be true

the untimely death of Brad
how sad it must have been
if you see him anywhere
remember to console him

I curse the day
I ever met the boy
only the good die young
they say
the details of his death are vague
unbelievable it seems
as if his passing was only a dream
catastrophe, calamity
what will we tell his mother now?
cataclysmic, a tragic mishap
I just heard that their band is breaking up

I hear his trumpet
his voice rings in my ears
it sometimes seems he's standing very near
I don't believe in ghosts
I've never seen one
but isn't the trumpet playing haunting on this album?

the untimely death of Brad
how sad it must have been
if you see him anywhere
remember to console him

a day that lives in infamy
in horror we behold
his passing
his memory
but the truth must be toldaieee... I love my pantalones
they fit me oh so tight
they make me smile with delight
do you like Five Iron Frenzy
singing about their pants?
it's kind of silly
brings on romance

"man I wish I had those pants!"
