they shall have stars at elbow and foot; 
though they go mad they shall be sane, 
though they sink through the sea they shall rise again; 
though lovers be lost love shall not; 
and death shall have no dominion.

then diesI was the future
in nineteen-ninety-five
I watched the flashbulbs burst
whenever I'd arrive
I'd tape my knuckles up
cinched and tight for the ring
just beneath the gloves
clenching white for the swing
I was a sellout
before a sellout crowd
I threw the fight in my head
before the fat lady bowed
you want a tip-off
some good advice for the brawl?
just wear a mouth-guard
to keep your teeth when you fall
and when you quit
make sure that you can wash your hands of it

armed to the teeth
score one for treachery
I am a mercenary
there's more lies here
than we can all bury
I am a mercenary

I have seen the headlines
swarming thick with flies
I have seen the Billboard Charts
I have heard them spitting lies
here's to your lame award
your phony Nobel Prize
here's to the suckers lining up
to see us compromise
let's light a campfire
we will have a sing along
I will burn some bridges
you will bring the crappy songs
and when you quit
make sure that you can wash your hands of it

armed to the teeth
score one for treachery
I am a mercenary
there's more lies here
than we can all bury
I am a mercenary

there's a part of me I have compromised
buried somewhere under ghosts of lies
make it quick, make it sick
turn the crank and just play the greatest hits... sigh
there's a part of me that I despise
pull the curtain back and see what dies
emerald spires of the near profound
let's burn this lousy city down

right

armed to the teeth
score one for treachery
I am a mercenary
there's more lies here
than we can all bury
I am a mercenary

armed to the teeth
score one for treachery
I am a mercenary
there's more lies here
than we can all bury
I am a mercenary

yeahfilthy bird laying in our yard
four chambered heart never beat so hard
dad said she was almost gone
upside down out on our lawn
and I could hold her in a shoe box
If she heals she could be mine
and if I cannot save her spirit
dad says I should break her spine
shaking, brilliant, silver-black wings
Jesus Christ, what prayers these tears sing

wear your hearts out on your sleeves for
starlings... starlings
of the least of all of these
are starlings... starlings

two years pass, I pumped the chamber
full of air to shoot the birds
harmless game to hit them slightly
scare them off, in other words
starling falling to her death
piercing copper steals her breath
see the flutter in her breast, starving babies in her nest
raise their souls up to the sky
why must helpless creatures die?

wear your hearts out on your sleeves for
starlings... starlings
of the least of all of these
are starlings... starlings

every breath has sacred weight
every life has some design
can we kill and also save
speak of life
while digging graves?

raise their souls up to the sky
why must helpless creatures die?

wear your hearts out on your sleeves for
starlings... starlings
of the least of all of these
are starlings... starlings

wear your hearts out on your sleeves for
starlings... starlings
of the least of all of these
are starlings... starlingstiny speakers are mounted into the ceiling
barely visible next to the grey-white tiles
dripping wet with the syrup-sweet production
all the words for the empty in screaming piles?
we will find the truth down in the basement
hiding out beneath the pavement
just beneath the reach of pajamas on a sea of green?

the vision is underground
the culture is out of bounds
it's still a persuasive sound
the music is still around but its underground

choreography never replaced conviction
smoke and lighting can not manufacture style
propaganda can make truth sound like fiction
greater numbers deluded, but not worthwhile?
down below in the resistance
sheer defiance builds in cadence
pure and passionate, that's right
there's nothing here to lose?

the vision is underground
the culture is out of bounds
yeah it's still a persuasive sound
the music is still around but its under

the vision is underground

real change doesn't come from a mandate
real love you cannot legislate
real change doesn't come from a mandate
real love you cannot legislate
real change doesn't come from a mandate
real love you cannot legislate
real change doesn't come from a mandate
real love you cannot legislateif the throttle is pulled
back to burn through the fuel
and the mix is just right
but the speed is too cruel
then even the strongest
will slowly burn into ashes
in the atmosphere

when you burn too fast
if you give it too much gas
wave goodbye to it all
oh how the mighty fall
oh how the truth may slip
tied to the breaking mast
when you burn too fast

oh, you will pay it in blood
that kerosene fuels the evil flame
where they have forgotten your name
and you will never last
and you will die very young
when you burn too fast

and the promises
they may or may not have made (whoa)
are just the needles sticking into your veins
pumping all of their sick lies into you (whoa)
until you're stupid enough
to look the other way
when you burn too fast

when you walk that plank
when the stench gets rank
when their knuckles dig so deep in your back
you just turn the crank
It's when they bury you
they never cared for you
just that you burn too fast

when they have bled you dry
and they cast you aside
then they will put out their hands to be friends
like they never lied
when that last light glides
and you wave goodbye
that’s when you burn too fast

hold your hands to the dying fire's final glow
warm yourself by the last breath of the radio
batteries, are almost gone
sing goodbye to that old song
lincoln's words, they stare at me
his better angels tear at me
and I believe

and we will burn, the starless night
the truth will ring through depths of twilight
liberty, our hearts ignite
let hope still ring through depths of twilight

did you hear the thunderous voice of Dr. King?
the ghost of hope still strikes its brilliant lightning
through the dark our hearts will scream
for a world we have only dreamed
and the past, it will decay
so sing goodbye to yesterday
and I believe

and we will burn, the starless night
the truth will ring through depths of twilight
liberty, our hearts ignite
let hope still ring through depths of twilight

and we will burn, the starless night
the truth will ring through depths of twilight
liberty, our hearts ignite
let hope still ring through depths of twilight

this day we will be able to speed up the day when justice will spring like water

and we will burn, the starless night
the truth will ring through depths of twilight
liberty, our hearts ignite
let hope still ring through depths of twilight

and we will burn, the starless night
the truth will ring through depths of twilight
liberty, our hearts ignite
let hope still ring through depths of twilight

there is no doubt today
the cynics and the critics have faded dead away
every wound has healed
the meaning of their struggles has now been revealed

confetti is falling like snow
supporters are waving their signs
it’s a hero’s homecoming
it’s a hero’s homecoming
it’s a hero’s homecoming today

they have waited all their lives
for the day of rest and resolution to arrive
their heads and hands raised high
the ones who went before them standing by their sides

confetti is falling like snow
supporters are waving their signs
it’s a hero’s homecoming
it’s a hero’s homecoming
it’s a hero’s homecoming today

underneath the smiles
a melancholy weighs upon them all the while
they can’t forget the cost –
the innocence of youth and brave ones who were lost…

confetti is falling like snow
supporters are waving their signs
confetti is falling like snow
supporters are waving their signs
confetti is falling like snow
supporters are waving their signs
it’s a hero’s homecoming
it’s a hero’s homecoming
a hero’s homecoming today

on this day

todaygo ahead

uh it was September of 2005

since the accident? 

well

it’s still kind of hard to talk about it

I mean, we were stranded in a um

do you know what a geosynchronous orbit is?

yeah, it uh, it would have been almost impossible to get clear of it, 
but no one could have known that one of our systems 
would fail:

the guiding system, the third engine.
I guess they test the computers there and they said it 
was the third engine on our rocket.
haha! yeah, I guess that's one way to put it.
I still think about it from time to time, I guess.
um, but that isn't anything. 
it's bad, but ya know nothing like the loneliness out 
there in the dark.
I miss the other guys sometimes, but I never miss the 
rocket.
I just spoke with major Culp a few days ago. He 
actually was a New Jersey man.
I guess we all kinda feel the same way about it, that 
we miss the excitement of it all,
but no one really wants to go through that part again.
it sometimes feels so hollow, like nothing can make it 
come back.
I apologize, um yeah, it was an accident. the anti-
matter, I mean, like all of it an accident.
and Lieutenant Hoerig, I mean his family, I still talk 
to them every now and again.
I'm sorry it's just, uh, it's sometimes I still miss 
him.
I can't believe he's gone, but it was him, he saved the 
mission.it’s 9:15. I’m climbing up into morning
lungs are screaming for air. enshrouded shapes are forming
I see his vacant stare. I heard him calling on the radio
first one this year. we couldn’t reach him through blinding snow
he pushed too hard. that’s what everybody said
it snowed three days he must be dead

I’m trying to break through
I am reaching for the sky
I am frayed, torn in two through fields of the fallen lost in the gray

it’s 4:18. every step brings me homeward
through the valley of death, there he sits like monument

and I blame myself, for lack of endeavor
but I must press on, lest I become another
if I slow down my heart may shatter from within
no I will not become him

I’m trying to break through
I am reaching for the sky
my lips are cracked, bleeding
blue, I’m still calling for you
my arms stretch toward you
I want to look you in the eye
spread your wings won’t you, over the fallen?
lost in the gray

battle creek
something that you said last week
is eating me with sharpened teeth
and I am so afraid
not something thrown out flippantly
but to my heart and very core
I may not see you anymore
or something even worse
and in my bones
your twenty-three same chromosomes
reside in twisted prophecy
likening our destinies
I genuflect
I will hold my breath
I will wait and see
your blood is swimming inside me
and there is no love
like fathers have for their sons...
sons

I am weak
but believe me when I softly speak
if there is strength inside of me
it’s you who put it there
and I concede
that something stabbed and made you bleed
stole the light you once believed
yet I still do
do you believe
I saw your father in a dream?
he said that he is safe and well
and waiting up for us
and there is no love
like fathers have for their sons

boys need fathers
every daughter
every broken heart so gone
I believe that Love is greater
never ceasing, always hoping
always just beneath the dawn

and there is no love
like fathers have for their sons

boys need fathers
every daughter
every broken heart so gone
I believe that Love is greater
never ceasing, always hoping
always just beneath the dawn

boys need fathers
every daughter
every broken heart so gone
I believe that Love is greater
never ceasing, always hoping
always just beneath the dawn

received December seventh at three twenty pm

hey Reese this is Jerry uh I was just calling ‘cause I got your number off the internet and uh I saw your MySpace and my mom was always a big Five Iron fan and I kinda live close by to you, um I got your address off the internet too but um anyway you could come over, my mom makes awesome sandwiches, and maybe we could play kickball or something give me a call! my number is

message erased

I am the ghost
of haunting hope
a trailing phantom
some withering wisp of smoke
slipping by
and these are my words
flung through the sky
trailing red like a cape
longing to fly
on this, their thirteenth try
this prison of mine
is to carry alone
the light of one red sun
beneath my skin
and never, ever go home
to watch the ravens fly
so very far, far away

fortress of solitude
I will stay here, I will make you all believe
and if my words have forked no lightning
never shall I sleep again

with sickening speed
red hearts on blue sleeves
the bullets of your words
could scarcely set their teeth into me
but I am made frail
in one single bound
my traitorous soil
slings me so far down
without a sound
to watch the ravens fly
so very far, far away

fortress of solitude
I will stay here, I will make you all believe
and if my words have forked no lightning
never shall I sleep again

never going to stop, not a break in my stride
never let this cancer eat from inside
raise the flag high with fists to the sky
I will finish this, or this is good-bye
spies, to the right set their claws to kill me
lies from the left clasp their jaws on the guilty
I will break free, I will break free
just you watch me
so discouraged, so dismayed
see the poison, dripping from their blades
there is lightning, left in these words
I will still fly, rising with the birds
I have carried the sun in my skin
I cannot stop, I can not win
forked tongues, forcing me to kneel
as if I was no man made of steel
what if these weak words, that I have tripped on
sing that I am the last son of Krypton?
I hate you all
I hate you all
this will never sleepblessed are the land-mines
stretched across the desert floor
God, bless the hands that formed them
filled their shrapnel hearts with war
may You bless the companies
the goose that laid the golden egg
may they make a million more
blowing off a million legs
blessed are the black-tongued ravens
substituting fear for reason:
" to hate war is to hate us
if you love peace, then you must love treason."
beat your plowshares into swords
beat your pulpits, turn your tables
blessed are the hand-grenades
bless the church who rattles sabers

this house
is burning
this poison still is worming
this temple
will cave in
there's nothing here worth saving

nail the gold up to the altar
like Ahab taunts his crew to war
blessed are the shareholders
lack of faith is for the poor
hold your wallets to the sky
a temple built to soothe yourself
blessed is the church who tries
to help you build your blessed wealth

this house
is burning
this poison still is worming
this temple
will cave in
there's nothing here worth saving

this house
is burning
this poison still is worming
this temple
will cave in
there's nothing here worth saving

you know I do not know about this doctrine of assassination but if he thinks that we’re trying to assassinate him I think that we really oughta go ahead and do it, it’s a whole lot cheaper than starting a war

blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth

we have the ability to take him out and I think the time has come to move on him 

blessed are the mercy, for they shall obtain mercy

we do not need another two hundred billion dollar war

blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God

we do not need another two hundred billion dollar war

blessed are the peacemakers
blessed are the peacemakers
blessed our house bless this mess

this house
is burning
this poison still is worming
this temple
will cave in
there's nothing here worth saving

this house
is burning
this poison still is worming
this temple
will cave in
there's nothing here worth savingall right

hah I’m being promoted to major? yeah well uh, I I guess. tell captain Roper I said congratulations as well

well actually we returned in the escape pod, externally, the Gloria is still drifting somewhere past Saturn’s last moon Skathi

yeah well, life is good, different, but good
you know, it’s good to be home, it’s a little less exciting but maybe a little less triumphant

of course, you know, they really went all out, you know, the ticker tape parade, the president, that’s good that even though things didn’t go as planned, people still loved us. you know, they didn’t care that we failed. I guess our families were the most excited and the happiest to have us back.

yeah, it’s it’s something us. the things we had to do with those fuel cells. really was a miracle, I mean it was an impossible narrative, to go that far with anything, I mean it wasn’t like we went up there on a school bus, and we didn’t shoot up to the moon and back, I mean what happened with the Discovery and Starling and the batteries, it was an accident, that was the thing

do I have anything to say to the next generation of astronauts?

yeah, I… yes I do. you know do not, do not ever forget the people that put you into space, I guess. the people on the ground who did all the work. your friends and your families. they’re the ones who get all the parades. can’t forget that no matter what happens, whatever goes wrong, there is always support. there’s a purpose to all these things. 

grieve your losses, and do not forget the price of it all, but know that somehow it all becomes worthwhile. 

there’s just always something to hope for

always just beneath the dawnall the pieces hit the ground with a sick sound
time frames moving in slow motion
sifting through setting in as the smoke clears
consequences marching in rotation
got a feeling that this is gonna bruise
I’m pretty sure this is gonna be costly
sit down ‘cause there’s nothing left to do
hands covering your head and you wish you could start again…

fire comes and it burns the brush away
…rain comes down
snow falling in a lifeless grey
…sun comes down
something new comes cautiously from the dust
and spreads its limbs toward the heavens

colors bleed and they mix into a dull brown
the more you mix the more its getting darker
heat rises and it leaves behind a luke-warm
feel it go, feel a heart get harder
losing something that you said you’d never lose
you trade it in for something that you can’t stand
let go now there’s nothing left to do
hands covering your head now you’re ready to start again…

fire comes and it burns the brush away
…rain comes down
snow falling in a lifeless grey
…sun comes down
something new comes cautiously from the dust
and spreads its limbs toward the heavens

a second chance is all you have left
remember why you cling to this gift
a new day, a new start, the world turns
sometimes you have got to crash before you learn

fire comes and it burns the brush away
…rain comes down
snow falling in a lifeless grey
…sun comes down

fire comes and it burns the brush away
…rain comes down
snow falling in a lifeless grey
…sun comes down

fire comes and it burns the brush away
…rain comes down
something new comes cautiously from the dust
and spreads its limbs toward the heavens

in this broken place where I was born
it seems there is no peace
and the very soil we walk upon
is filled with tears that never cease
and you can trace the scars of hopelessness
like sweat upon the backs
of all the outcast and downtrodden
water slips through cracks

hold on, hold tight

and I am overwhelmed with grief
to see such suffering
for those who lack the voice to speak
all those of us left stuttering
may this not prevail
dear Lord, Your love will never fail

and these frail hands
they tremble as they pen perhaps their last
and these weak words
can never say what cannot be surpassed
I need Your love
and most of all I want to feel Your peace
I need Your love
let everything that You are not decrease

when the concrete of the world
becomes too cumbersome to lift
and the cataracts of fear and doubt
cloak truth beyond what we can sift:
and darkness, darkness bleeds its way
when crippling anguish clouds our sight
the ghosts of dusk have bared their teeth
set their claws to bring the night

hold on, hold tight

darkness can't perceive the light
though lightlessness has chilled us numb
and though its wings may cloud the skies
the dark shall never overcome
Light of the World
Your love, has never failed

and these frail hands
they tremble as they pen perhaps their last
and these weak words
can never say what cannot be surpassed
I need Your love
and most of all I want to feel Your peace
I need Your love
let everything that You are not decrease

one minor malfunction can terminate the whole operation
lost forever in the void of space
Voyager confirmed that Titan is one of only four bodies in the solar system that are solid and have a substantial mass

it was named for Saturn’s mythological brothers, the giant titans,

the climax of the mission’s touchdown on titan’s surface

you could reach out and touch is what it looked like

smallest grain of rice

and it was the highest

Titan’s surface

the solar system

transmits data and images for one hundred eighty minutes




and these frail hands
they tremble as they pen perhaps their last
and these weak words
can never say what cannot be surpassed
I need Your love
and most of all I want to feel Your peace
I need Your love
let everything that You are not decrease

and these (Your love)
frail hands (Your mercy)
they tremble as they pen perhaps their last (Your light unending)
and these (Your hope)
weak words (Your peace) 
can never say what cannot be surpassed (Your strength my heart is mending)

I need (Daylight) (Your love) 
Your love (Your mercy)
and most of all I want to feel Your peace (save me) (Your light unending)
I need (Daylight) (Your hope)
Your love (Your peace)
let everything that You are not decrease (save me) (Your strength my heart is mending)


I have been breaking my back...yeah
only to show You
how very lost one can be
and bitterness fires through me
the brilliance that was
is flickering cold
slowly burning to ash
I'm choking on pride
I'm closing my eyes
till one day I'm scared to go back

You part the shadows
Light of the World
destroy the blindness
Peace Eternal

take this broken heart
if it brings you praise
take this beaten soul
shivering hands I will raise
Hope Unstoppable
sing the morning sun
wake up, oh sleeper
the Daylight has come

You are, You are
Invincible
You are, you are
Unbreakable

take this broken heart (You are)
if it brings you praise (the shadow)
take this beaten soul 
shivering hands I will raise (Light of the World)
Hope Unstoppable (destroy)
sing the morning sun (the blindness)
wake up, oh sleeper 
the Daylight has come (Peace Eternal)
