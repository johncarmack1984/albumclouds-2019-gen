in perfect orbit they have circled
as the light of many worlds falls softly on their skin
and days here pass like minutes
one moment of brilliant daylight will shift into the next
a flash of dark behind some distant lost moon
and then it is over
like the pause before waking
sleep is replaced by light, and life and hope
it is the light of one far away sun that has beckoned them to leave
and the hope of home that has lifted them from slumber
the hope that though the dark may come
the sun also rises

the chord runs up the microphone
I flip the switch, we're going home
transistor's right on time
resistors fall in line
capacitors are at full
all engines good, no breach of hull
with all the hope that I could beg or borrow
I can't wait, can't wait for tomorrow

I believe the sun also rises
dries our tears
bringing the blue skies of day
I believe the sun also rises
lighting our paths, driving the darkness away
so far away
so far away

microchips will pave the way
the circuitry will work ok
with all the hope that i could beg or borrow
I can't wait, can't wait for tomorrow

I believe the sun also rises
dries our tears
bringing the blue skies of day
I believe the sun also rises
lighting our paths, driving the darkness away
so far away
so far away


cabin pressure coming down by seven 
OK 
it’s flying very smooth now

sky is looking very dark outside 
cabin pressure is holding at six one OK
roger cabin pressure holding at six one
sky looking very dark outside
roger we hear you loud and clear
it’s quite dark that’s clear

I believe the sun also rises
dries our tears
bringing the blue skies of day
I believe the sun also rises
lighting our paths, driving the darkness away
so far away
so far away
so far away
so far awayblessed is the man who does prevail
doomed are the peacemakers when they fail
if hope springs eternal it never does here
I guess i lost all my hope last year
I tried to steal the moon from the sky
I am lost and lonely
I drift in space
my dreams are haunted by her face
blessed are the drifters, the stars that die
whose light expires, before goodbyes
goodbye, goodbye

binary star
you're the brightest blue by far
and up against the starry sea
I thought that you were meant for me

blessed are the meek who shall inherit
the throes of death for all their merit
the right to stumble, to fall and perish
doomed are those who hold and cherish
I tried to steal the moon from the sky
you hide behind your broken wings
your dreams are all for better things
and in the dark we climb this slope
cause the bravest thing of all is always hope
goodbye, goodbye

binary star
you're the brightest blue by far
and up against the starry sea

oldest chords in history
I guess I lost all ambition turning left on Missouri
I could have made it better
but the feelings just aren't there
my heart is cold and black
but i just don't think i care
so here's to me saying "fare-thee-well"
and when you hear this song i hope it hurts like hell

you're beautiful, but not beneath your skin

so hollow, like your wedding bells.)

the phone lines down in mexico are
slow and may be tired
I guess all your devotion got
lost inside the wires
well i hope you cannot sleep, and i
hope you cannot smile
and i hope that you are burdened with
your guilt for quite a while
I hope you fall in love
but i hope your plans are thwarted
and i hope that now you're back
it's because you were deported

but she's barely breaking stride
when i look and see her standing there
I'm all butterflies inside
her name means "the resurrection"
it's not too far from true
I'm afraid that if i write this song
she might break my heart in two

she hits the mark
the kindled spark
but I'll just drag her down
down 

far away in distant skies
I see starlight in your eyes
do you think of miracles
are they only dreams for fools
she's the one who haunts my dreams at night
underneath the bluest moon
she makes hearts skip beats in triplets
the brightest light in any room

she hits the mark
the kindled spark
but I'll just drag her down
down, down, down, down

a darkness that will spy on me
eclipsed in this trajectory
a cancer that is eating me

destroy, divide
the dark inside

in between the molecules is cold
no light for shaking fingers to ever have their hold
and I'm afraid I'll never see the light
the blind are following in sightless plight

here it comes

titans looming over me
giants that are crushing me

GodspeedI write clever words on paper
I sometimes think I don't believe at all
I've never felt so fake
so false
I'm such a lie
I couldn't even look him in the eyes
he was 25 like I was
but he was deaf and slowly going blind
he made my faith seem worthless;
the things I hoped were pointless
and he fought to stay but
always dreamed that he could leave this place

the angels wings will cover you tonight
hallelujah
oress your head against the breast of Christ
hallelujah

it made me feel so empty
collapsing on some dirty bathroom floor
and isn't it just like me to mourn his passing breath
when he will never suffer anymore
beautiful his pictures
fading black and silver
and I sing of faith but his was true and fierce
and I will miss him

the angels wings will cover you tonight
hallelujah
press your head against the breast of Christ
hallelujah

the angels wings will cover you tonight
hallelujah
press your head against the breast of Christ
hallelujah

the angels wings will cover you tonight
hallelujahthe girl in the alley kneels with exhaustion
she's guarded by the skinny guy who limps from some infection
behind a veil of bleached thin hair, her eyes tell a story
like a photo of Berlin, December 1944
she's looking for a handout; she's been high for several weeks now
she's too far gone for whoring, and the money just gave out

and her heart still beats inside
and the blood runs in her veins
a remanent of life remains
and her heart still beats inside

the man finally comes to the door; I've seen him several times
he always looks pissed off, and his sunglasses stay on
I think he got his biceps and tattoos while in prison
and it doesn't seem to bother him when he says "go to hell”

and his heart still beats inside
and the blood runs in his veins
a remanent of life remains
and his heart still beats inside

the thought, it comes to my mind, to somehow intervene
but it could bring me trouble, and what could I do anyway?
it's hard to be affected when it happens so often:
to see a life unraveling through drawn venetian blinds

I'm sickened by compassion, I'm stifled by my limitations
anesthetic apathy, take the pain away

and my heart still beats inside
and the blood runs in my veins
a remanent of life remains
and my heart still beats inside

oh God, we need you here (our hearts still beat inside)
we're sinking fast and we don't care (and the blood runs in our veins)
the evidence is all around me (a remanent of life remains)
on both sides of my door (our hearts still beat inside)

our hearts beat (our hearts still beat inside)
our hearts beat (our hearts still beat inside)
our hearts beat (our hearts still beat inside)
our hearts beat
incandescent moon is shining just for you tonight
shimmering, a golden halo, does it follow just beyond your sight?
sigh. you're an angel wanting wings for flight, tonight
babies breath in the waxing light
glassy seas of blue
I will dream of you

let's close our eyes till daylight comes
babies breath and chrysanthemums
so beaming blue, these dreaming skies
in soundless sleep now close your eyes
'til daylight, 'til daylight comes
'til daylight, 'til daylight comes
just close your eyes ’til daylight comes

I keep feeling that the strangest peace is all around
in the speechless, in this quiet, angels never make a single sound
sigh. babies breath and lilacs so profound
falling down
softest moonlight, making garlands, forms the crown
glassy seas of blue
I will dream of you

let's close our eyes till daylight comes
babies breath and chrysanthemums
so beaming blue, these dreaming skies
in soundless sleep now close your eyes
'til daylight, 'til daylight comes
'til daylight, 'til daylight comes
just close your eyes ’til daylight comes
just close your eyes ’til daylight comes
’til daylight comes
did you see me falling down from heaven
breaking every bone I have?
so I tried to touch the sun
I had another fall
you can do the math
I was wrong, is what they'll say
I'll watch their smiles fade away
I'll watch their black-and-white turn gray
their picture-perfect worlds decay

today I fell to earth again, again
I guess I failed You
I guess I cannot win
today
today, I fell away
I fell away

did you see me falling down from heaven
trailing wings of melted wax?
accelerate
at nine point eight
accept the fact I'm going to crash
and so-called friends have gone away
and all advice will cease to stay today

today on fragile wings I tried to touch the sun
as wax and feathers melted
all my dreams have come undone
today

You lift my battered soul
You mend my broken wings together
You lift my battered soul
You'll mend my broken bones together
You lift my battered soul
You'll mend my broken bones together
You lift my battered soul
You'll mend my broken bones together

yeah

today, today, 
I fell away, I fell away

today, today, 
I fell away, I fell away

it was all about acceleration
all for notoriety
all about destination
driven by my own abilities
rockets shattered, screamed, and then fell away
lift this juggernaut into the sky
radio waves in the frozen night, spelling "I miss you”

like a flicker of light in the back of my mind
it all comes back to me
like an overdue sunrise
it all comes back to me
(I remember Your love being better than life
when it all comes back to me
I will sing in the shadows, when it all comes back…)

there's nothing like complete exhaustion
the atrophy of complete defeat
the feeling of the world upon my shoulders
and realizing I am incomplete
well there's a lot of freedom in failure
of recklessness of weightless abandonment
I remember light coming through stained glass
and it reminds me…

like a flicker of light in the back of my mind
it all comes back to me
like an overdue sunrise
it all comes back to me
(I remember Your love being better than life
when it all comes back to me
I will sing in the shadows, when it all comes back…)

when it all comes back…
when it all comes back…
to me

when it all comes back to me
when it all comes back to me
when it all comes back to me
when it all comes back to me
hey yeah yeah
back to me
it all comes back
it all comes back to me
it all comes back
it all comes back to me
back to me
back to me 
back to me
back to me
it all comes back to me
when it all comes back to medeepest oceans of despair
this vast and somber
charcoal night of space
have you given up yet?
what hope lingers in the crevasses and corners of your soul?
I know you
you haven't given up yet
you are brave in this darkness, Saint Saturn
sometimes the bravest thing of all is to hopedid you hear the news today
I'm not coming home
no
and i wished it all away
I felt so alone
yeah
and the darkness crept it's way
like stars that we all know will die too soon
there is never any sunrise here in the shadows of eclipsing moons
crawling on a tightrope
the bravest thing i have is hope

daylight, save me
daylight, save me
tonight, tonight

halogen, the lights will flicker
incadescent burning lies
and the silence stands for nothing
desperate i search the skies 
aching for a spark
trembling in pitchest dark

daylight, save me
daylight, save me
tonight, tonight

Jesus Christ, Light of the World
You never did forget me
and when i bled in darkness, You held
me
still held me
when desparate nights i cursed You
You loved me, still loved me

You break my heart of stone
Your words are life
cut marrow through
the darkness, to the bone
a heart of flesh You gave me
only You can save me
