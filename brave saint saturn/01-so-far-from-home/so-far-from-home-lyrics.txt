just on the border of your waking mind
there lies... another time
where darkness & light are one
and as you tread the halls of sanity
you feel so glad to be
unable to go on
I have a message
from another time…

Godspeed

so far, so good,
or so they say from mission control,
the deep of space is no place
for a fragile human soul.
the rockets burn as servos click and turn
and fall into their place.
robots can't cry,
don't laugh,
can't die,
in the darkness of space.
he is strong, made of steel
with the graphite lining,
watch his eyes flicker slow
like the batteries are dying.

space robot 5,
is he alive?
so very alone,
so far from home...
Three strands of wire,
threefold the tie that binds.
she is the one thing on the earth
for which he still pines.
to his heart she was life,
so he prays to his maker with a sigh,
as his fire sputters out,
because robots never cry.

she carries all the weight of her own world
and somewhere deep inside
beneath the cartilage and bone
beats the battered heart of one little girl alone

she is sweet, like sugar
but she is bitter like the broken sugar pot
dad says that she could be
anything she wants to be
she only sees what she is not

disbeliever
underachiever
disconcerted with the way things look from here
disinclined and disinterested
nothing in your world stays clear

with the blanket of security
and the mighty force of her own will
treading water in her pink pajamas
she is treading water still

hopelessly, hopeless and
she is swimming further into the sea
thinking she's substandard
while all the while, she is beautiful to me

disbeliever
underachiever
don't you shed another tear
little sister
broken heart resistor
it's not like that over here

she is strong and silent
she is blunt and shrewd
she thinks that nobody loves her
if she only knew
how much we all have missed her
we are praying for you

one time on the fourth of July
I went out to watch the fireworks fly
from the hill I could see all the rockets as they flew from the town below me
bombs bursting in the air
the crowd was cheering with every flare
but, in the distance the clouds were cracking and flashing
mountains shaking with every explosion

and I remembered thinking that night
as I looked into the sky
more than pyrotechnics meets the eye

and the fireworks fly
and the fireworks fall
but I have seen the best of all
and its true
after every charge is through
I can still hear the thunder call

glitter bombs turn pasty pale
under five-mile electric trails
soaring skies and lofty sierras
never looked quite as big in the pictures
neon flickers in the haze
bilboards set to catch our gaze
so much noise
nothing holds our attention
it has all been done before

so let the rockets sparkle and fade
let the streamers fill the sky
more than pyrotechnics meets the eye

and the fireworks fly
and the fireworks fall
but I have seen the best of all
and its true
after every charge is through
I can still hear the thunder

and the fireworks fly
and the fireworks fall
but I have seen the best of all
and its true
after every charge is through
I can still hear the thunder callyesterday while walking
beneath an overpass
I saw the figure of Jesus
standing barefoot on broken glass

his beard was graying
smell of urine filled the air
asking if I had some change
anything that I could spare

and do do do do 
do do do do do do 
do do do do do

emaciated
his shaking fist balled up
influenza and pneumonia
begging God to take his cup

so different from his pictures
breathing air through yellowed tubes
Jesus Christ, dying of AIDS
can look right through you

and do do do do 
do do do do do do 
do do do do do

and all have hated
crucified and walked away
savior of the prostitutes
drunkards, rapists, and the gays

"the crew of Apollo 8 has a message that we would like to send to you...
'in the beginning, God created the heaven and the earth.’"

under bridges
with hands raised
from the ghettos
they praise His name

broke and crippled
in the dark of night
raise your voices
to Jesus Christ

halleluja hallelujaheverything seemed at first to be proceeding normally
everything seemed at first to be proceeding normally
engines now controlling
engines now controlling
help me throttle it down to about 
sixty-five percent
sixty-five percenta Friday night affair
out in the city heat
always a party there
along the sordid street
and it was guaranteed
the place to be was Rocketown

the drinks were two for one
inside the crowded bars
the girls would make their run
down on the boulevard
it was the idol place
we lived the ways of Rocketown
hang around by the street light
in the heart of the night life

there came a certain man
a stranger to the crowd
we didn't understand
what he was all about
he walked a different pace
so out of place in Rocketown

yeah

they made a fool of him
hey teased him when he's speak
but when they knocked him down
he turned the other cheek
he told me I could find
a life outside of Rocketown

hang around by the street light
in the heart of the night life

what was his mission
where was he going
why was his heart light always glowing?
all I was missing
he stood there holding
what was his secret
could I know it?

some didn't like him near
some laughed and turned away
but me, I longed to hear
all that he had to say
he had a peace of mind
I couldn't find in Rocketown
and when I reached down inside me
I could feel the emptiness

what was his mission
where was he going
why was his heart light always glowing?
all I was missing
he stood there holding
what was his secret
could I know it?

he said it's in the heart
this change that comes to be
now he had done his part
the rest was up to me
as we were standing there
he said a prayer for Rocketown
as we were standing there
he said a prayer for Rocketown

as we were standing there
he said a prayer for Rocketown

he walked off silently
and prayed for me
and Rocketown…

down at Rocketown
they said the surface was suffocating
they said the distance wasn't worth the waiting
they said the pressure could crush the spirit of a man
but none of them see the heavens
from the place where I stand

she is the brightest star that's in the sky
she is the reason every astronaut would fly
I see the lighting clouds of white on cobalt fields of blue
and I close my eyes and sigh
I can't believe it's true

the moon is burning bright
I saw her face tonight
I touched the seamless beauty with my hands
I'm never going back again

they said I'm foolish
fleeting hopes in borrowed dreams
they said forget her
the moon is far beyond your reach
I would run out of fuel long before I'd ever land
but none of them can see this world
from the place where I stand

the moon is burning bright
I saw her face tonight
I touched the seamless beauty with my hands
I'm never going back againEngines at sixty-five percent
three engines uh running normally 
three good fuel cells
three good AVUs

velocity twenty-two hundred and fifty-seven feet per second
altitude four point three nautical miles
downrange distance three nautical miles

engines throttling up, three engines now at a hundred and four percent

Challenger go with throttle up

uh we’ve got a problem 

no one told me it was going to rain today
I turn my face down from the sky
something broke inside my heart today
Christmas presents on the day she died
crippled dreams are never mentioned
broken things that never heal
mother said for me to give it time
tonight I cannot help but cry
February twenty-nine

In a world of dying children
rain never seems to cease
I will hope for things unseen now
one day my heart will be at peace
I said I loved her and she knew it
whispered softly to the sky tonight
she is warm and safe in Heaven
in the loving arms of Jesus Christ

there is a place that we call heaven
a place where children never cry
where no one's ever cold or hungry
a place where you cannot go blind
I turn my face up to the sky now
I wipe the tears from my eyes
thank you God she lives forever
February February
February twenty-nine

In a world of dying children
rain never seems to cease
I will hope for things unseen now
one day my heart will be at peace
I said I loved her and she knew it
whispered softly to the sky tonight
she is warm and safe in Heaven
in the loving arms of Jesus Christ

do not go gentle into that good night
old age should burn and rave at close of day
rage, rage against the dying of the light

good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay
rage, rage against the dying of the light
rage, rage against the dying of the light
rage, rage against the dying of the light

In a world of dying children
rain never seems to cease
I will hope for things unseen now
one day my heart will be at peace
I said I loved her and she knew it
whispered softly to the sky tonight
she is warm and safe in Heaven
in the loving arms of Jesus Christgloria, in excelsis Deo
glory, gloria

too weak to wonder
too tired to care
Jesus Christ, are you really there?

I've fallen down
can't pull myself back up
I'm going to drown, have mercy
have mercy

gloria, in excelsis Deo
glory, gloria
glory

I need you now
not words or a feeling
but Jesus Christ
I've hit the ceiling

Your love
Your mercy
Your light unending
Your hope
Your peace
Your strength my heart is mending

Your hope
Your light unending
