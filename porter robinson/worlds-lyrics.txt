you see right through meis anyone there?
oh - hi!

who survived? somebody new?
anyone else but you?
on a lonely night was a blinding light
a hundred leaders would be borne of you

and though I know, since you've awakened her again
she depends on you, she depends on you
she will go alone, and never speak of this again
we depend on you, we depend on you
and though I know, since you've awakened her again
she depends on you, she depends on you
she will go alone, and never speak of this again
we depend on you, we depend
I will depend on you

hey

I don't know much about your life beyond these walls
the fleeting sense of love within these God-forsaken halls
and I can hear it in his voice, in every call
this girl who's slept a hundred years has something after all

and though I know, since you've awakened her again
she depends on you, she depends on you
I will go alone, and never speak of you again
we depend on you, we depend on you
and though I know, since you've awakened her again
she depends on you, she depends on you
she will go alone, and never speak of this again
we depend on you, we depend
I will depend on you

hi

take one last look at what you're leaving behind
'cause there's no coming back once we go
we are the children of an innocent crime
and its time to take down the throne
although our hands may shake
we will set the city ablaze for the treachery
we will spill their blood and set our fathers free

oh, two hundred years of war
fight till we are no more
a curse on the streets of gold
oh oh
just know, mine is a hand to hold
take back what the kingdom stole
a curse on the streets of gold 

oh, two hundred years of war
fight till we are no more
a curse on the streets of gold
just know, mine is a hand to hold
take back what the kingdom stole
a curse on the streets of gold

oh, two hundred years of war
fight till we are no more
a curse on the streets of gold
just know, mine is a hand to hold

trudging with my feet in the snow
on a day out, and in to the night now
doctor, I've been walking by the side of the road
for a long time, and I'm going out of my mind

it's so far from me now
but oh, I can hear the sound

It's so far from me now

can't you hear the bells sing in Cologne?
you won't hear it on the radio
madness is the hero carnival
can't you hear the bells?

sitting on a rooftop
crazy days are coming again
I've been running
but I will be hidden in the masquerade

it's so far from me now

hey 

we've been up all night trying to survive this endless fight
if you shoot them down, we can make it right, we will make it right
we will light the sky as they multiply, they multiply
no matter what they try, they won't take away our will to fight
if you shoot them down, we can make it right, we will make it right

whoa
they broke the walls we guarded
whoa
but we don't care about it
whoa
we will finish what we started
whoa
so promise me that
whoa
we will be the lionhearted
whoa
for we don't care about it
whoa
we will finish what we started
whoa
so promise me that they will fall

so promise me that 

no matter what they try, they won't take away our will to fight
if you shoot them down, we can make it right, we will make it right
and up against all odds, take a thousand lives, a thousand lives
so if you shoot them down, we can make it right, we will make it right

we will see creation come undone

we will see creation come undone
these bones that bound us will be gone
we will stir our spirits 'till we're one
then soft as shadows we will become

I cried, for I didn't think it could be true
that you and I might have always known one another
and that we could not only evoke, but conjure a place of our own
that everywhere that has ever existed
was all in service of our dream
now please, hear what I hear

let me explain
this ugliness, this cruelty, this repulsiveness
it will all die out
and now, I cry for all that is beautiful

let me explainthank you, I will say goodbye soon
though it’s the end of the world, don't blame yourself
and if it’s true, I will surround you and give life to a world
that's our own
thank you, I will say goodbye now
