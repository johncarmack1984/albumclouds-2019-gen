the sky is sinking 
into a lonely night
my steps are quickening with fear
fear of failing
fear that the worst is true
the accusations are still ringing in my ear
I cling to hope of finding you
when I ‘m back where I belong

return to you
because I really need to
return to you
I am desperate and dry
my heart is weary in a disenchanted land
return to you
I’m calling upon you
return to you
I can feel you by my side
see me reaching for the comfort of your hand

the world is violent
vengeance is glamorized
in fumes of insolence the wicked maxims fly
reduced to silence 
I feel like I need to scream
But the tides of hatred drown my plea to pacify
I cling to hope of finding you when I’m back where I belong

return to you
because I really need to
return to you
I am desperate and dry
my heart is weary in a disenchanted land
return to you
I’m calling upon you
return to you
I can feel you by my side
see me reaching for the comfort of your hand

can you see this battered heart?
I lift it up to you in splinters
and in shards
spirit softly fall on me
replace my despair with your serenity

return to you
because I really need to
return to you
I am desperate and dry
my heart is weary in a disenchanted land
return to you
I’m calling upon you
return to you
I can feel you by my side
see me reaching for the comfort of your hand

I am reaching for the comfort of your hand


I lift my eyes to the hills
where does my help come from
my help comes from the Lord
the maker of heaven and Earth
He will not let your foot slip
He who watches over you will not slumber
He who watches over Israel
will neither slumber nor sleep

the Lord watches over you
the Lord is the shade at your right hand
the sun will not harm you by day
nor the moon by night

the Lord will keep you from all harm
He will watch over your life
the Lord will watch over your coming and going
both now and forevermore

the Lord watches over you
the Lord is the shade at your right hand
the sun will not harm you by day
nor the moon by night

the Lord watches over you
the Lord is the shade at your right hand
the sun will not harm you by day
nor the moon by nightI have rejoiced with those who said to me 
“let’s go to the house of the Lord”
I rejoiced with those who said to me
“let’s go to the house of the Lord”
our feet are standing at the gates of Jerusalem
I rejoiced with those who said to me 
“let’s go to the house of the Lord”

brothers and sisters
let’s stand together
like beautiful threads woven tightly for our Lord
take my hand
and I will help you stand
and if I stumble 
you will give me strength

I have rejoiced with those who said to me 
“let’s go to the house of the Lord”
I rejoiced with those who said to me
“let’s go to the house of the Lord”
our feet are standing at the gates of Jerusalem
I rejoiced with those who said to me 
“let’s go to the house of the Lord”

on that which we may disagree
is less important 
than what we plainly see
take my pride
and cast it far aside
and let us bow as one
in worship to our God

I have rejoiced with those who said to me 
“let’s go to the house of the Lord”
I rejoiced with those who said to me
“let’s go to the house of the Lord”
our feet are standing at the gates of Jerusalem
I rejoiced with those who said to me 
“let’s go to the house of the Lord”

pray for me
and I will pray for you
there must be peace within these walls 
for them to stand
I will build you up 
and seek your security
because you love my Lord

I have rejoiced with those who said to me 
“let’s go to the house of the Lord”
I rejoiced with those who said to me
“let’s go to the house of the Lord”
our feet are standing at the gates of Jerusalem
I rejoiced with those who said to me 
“let’s go to the house 
go to the house
go to the 
go to the house of the Lord”I lift my eyes to You
to You whose throne is in Heaven
Have mercy on us O Lord
Have mercy on us

like the beggar’s eyes looking for compassion
like shivering sailors searching for their port
so our eyes look to the Lord our God
looking for mercy

I lift my eyes to You
to You
whose throne is in heaven
have mercy on us
o Lord, have mercy on us

words of contempt
can feel like blowing sand
sulfurous clouds 
are spewing from their mouths
piercing like thorns,
the shrapnel of scorn
from a carnal cannonade

like the beggar’s eyes
looking for compassion
like shivering sailors
searching for their port
so our eyes look to the Lord our God
looking for mercy

o Lord have mercy on us 
o Lord have mercy on us 
o Lord, we’re looking for mercyfloods of evil rose
these walls should have been taken
without the help of God
I surely would be broken
the strongest fortress;
a father’s hands
tempests are suddenly stilled again

arrows filled the air
each named by different failures
pierced the flesh of God
behind Him I am blameless
a loosened grip of the fowler’s snare
I touch the sky like a sparrow spared

and sing “how can my good fortune be ignored?
my help is in the name of the Lord
maker of heaven and earth
my help is in the name of the Lord
maker of heaven and earth”

the Lord is by my side
He keeps me though I slumber
my heart is His with love and
my days cannot be numbered
and when I’ve been purified by fire
I’ll take my place in the holy choir

and sing “how can my good fortune be ignored?
my help is in the name of the Lord
maker of heaven and earth
my help is in the name of the Lord
maker of heaven and earth
my help is in the name of the Lord
maker of heaven and earth
my help is in the name of the Lord
maker of heaven and earthwe crossed the river into a different world
helmets fastened
rifles gleaming in the sun
full of bravery
yet apprehensive
the smoke from twisted altars is rising from the hills

heaps and spires
dossiers of darker truths
glass and tires 
in piles of wasted youth

in this hostile colony
surround me
like the hills around the valley
surround me
surround me

when the smoke cleared
we saw the damage done
the random violence
spread with borrowed guns
in throes of wickedness
the adolescent two
showed us
what the depths of hate can do

heaps and spires
dossiers of darker truths
glass and tires
in piles of wasted youth

in this hostile colony
surround me
like the hills around the valley
surround me
pestilence is all I see
surround me
like the hills around the valley

surround me 
surround me

give amnesty oh Lord
to those who trust in You
You will be our fortress Lord
and You will not be moved

in this hostile colony
surround me
like the hills around the valley
surround me
pestilence is all I see
surround me
like the hills around the valley
surround me
surround mewhen we were released
we were like men dreaming
the women were laughing
and the children were singing
and then it was said among all the nations
that “the Lord has done great things for them”

restore for us your temple, o Lord
like waterfalls flow
let your mercies keep coming
and it will be said from every nation
“the Lord has done great things for us”

with a melody, 
said with a melody
a song of praise
our hearts raise 
a melody
singing a melody
songs of praise
our hearts raise

those who sow seeds with weeping 
soon will be reaping
with songs of thanksgiving
and it will be said
from every nation
“the Lord has done great things for us”


with a melody, 
said with a melody
a song of praise
our hearts raise 
a melody
singing a melody
songs of praise
our hearts raise

when you return,
you’ll mend what is broken
return what was taken
heal what was wounded
and it will be said
from every nation
that “the Lord has done great things for us”


with a melody, 
said with a melody
a song of praise
our hearts raise 
a melody
singing a melody
songs of praise
our hearts raise

with a melody, 
said with a melody
a song of praise
our hearts raise 
a melody
singing a melody
songs of praise
our hearts raise

so let it be said
from every nation
that “the Lord has done great things for us”houses on a hill
in the twilight still
regal stares at oceans
breathing

crafted by hands
like pillars of sand
strong as my will
and twice as deceiving

how I desire
to lay my tools down 
and say to myself
that my building is done

dreams will wash away
in darkness before day
rise and find 
a better beauty standing
standing

plans for more plans
for houses of sand
working late 
and rising early

day into night
repair and make right
all that was wasted
in a hurry

I blister my hands
raising frames
and panels
when the walls of my heart
are falling apart

dreams will wash away 
in darkness before day
rise and find
a better beauty standing
standing 

no mind can conceive
no eye can compare
with what the morning has
for us
a home for the homeless
rest for the restless
love for the loveless
let the Lord provideafternoon, four twenty-five in the rain
something comes to life
she looks at me
and I can feel the flowers blooming

second floor at three five three
I’m making sure she is close to me
our friends in the living room
are laughing at the TV

while in the kitchen
we place two settings
at a table built for three

table for three
in a blessed sanctuary
so much to see
but it will be alright
with some company

I spent a childhood
lost in dreams of the future
but still it seems
I have no idea
of what the word love
really means

the fusing of two lives together
choosing scenery and weather
I’m selfish and it shows
I’m sick without a cure
I’m learning what it means
to yield first to God
then to Her

our company is our Lord unseen
the author of love, creator of beauty
He has given us a fortune for free
surely He smiled when He showed her to me

so I stand at this threshold
here sifting through all the hope
and fear
her hand in mine
trembling like the first time

holding tightly to
the promise that our Father
has the best in mind

table for three
in a blessed sanctuary
so much to see
but it will be alright

at the table for three
in a blessed sanctuary
so much uncertainty
but it will be alright
with some companyI was born in the system
and the system was born in me
got a heart full of passion
for all the wrong reasons
blowing in circles 
like November leaves
I’ve been plowed down
like a field of wheat
but I have not been defeated

the Righteous Lord 
has cut the cords
and set me free
from the choking vine
that gripped my mind
with the tendrils of the world
mama, she could still hold me
when somebody told me we end up dirt in the ground

so I settled for some addictions
with a head full of fiction
as I waited around

I’ve been plowed down
like a field of wheat
but I have not been defeated

for the Righteous Lord 
has cut the cords
and set me free
from the choking vine
that gripped my mind
with the tendrils of the world

why do I get the feeling
that someone is smiling
when I am in pain?
Lord, come again quickly
and stop the accuser
put an end to this reign
I’ve been plowed down 
like a field of wheat
oh but I have not been defeated
the furrows run deep into my back
oh but I have not been defeated

for the Righteous Lord 
has cut the cords
and set me free
from the choking vine
that gripped my mind
with the tendrils of the worldfrom out of the darkness
I cry to you
o Lord
my only candle comes

with the soft light of your words

how can I stand before you?
mmm
in shame and pride
I hide from you
mmm
but your voice says
I am fearfully and wonderfully made
and with you there is forgiveness

my soul waits for the Lord
my soul waits for the Lord
and in His word
I put my hope
my soul waits more
than watchmen wait for the morning

all of creation testifies for You
in the eyes of an infant 
your promises come true

how can I reject you?
mmm
Lord I choose to include you
for in your eyes
is unfailing love
and your heart is full of redemption

and my soul waits for the Lord
my soul waits for the Lord
and in His word I put my hope
my soul waits more
than watchmen wait 
and my soul waits for the Lord
my soul waits for the Lord
and in His word I put my hope
my soul waits 
more than watchmen wait for the morning

I wait
more than watchmen wait for the morningtake one good gander at me
I’m very ordinary
no reason to be proud
I don’t want to ponder positions 
on origins and doctrines
I’ll never understand

oh trust comes very slowly
at least for me
I’d rather truth be shown me
and then believe
but finally I am absolved
from my own devices
I am free

I have quieted my soul
my heart is content
I have quieted my soul
and the morning is peaceful and still

I don’t need another science to see more
or to clear my conscience
the good news stands alone
I’m not in line for a ribbon
for pointing to the person
in whom all truth is known

oh -ologies, -isms, big words, and PhDs,
add nothing to what I have
with Christ in me
at last I am absolved
from my own devices
I’m free

I have quieted my soul
my heart is content
I have quieted my soul
and the morning is peaceful and still

in a microscope
from far away too
every detail
points to you

let every mouth
move to adore you
let every body
bow before you
Lord, let my heart be filled
with more of you

oh let every mouth
move to adore you
let every body
bow before you
Lord, let my heart be filled
with more of you

I have quieted my soul
I have quieted my soul
I have quieted my soul
